          <div class="tag" style="margin-top:6px">&lt;img src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/exterior-of-a-house-with-multiple-roof-top-solar-panels.jpg?id=62288939&amp;amp;width=2000&amp;amp;height=1500&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;German utility RWE implemented the &lt;a href=&#34;https://uplight.com/blog/what-is-virtual-power-plant/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;first known virtual power plant&lt;/a&gt; (VPP) in 2008, aggregating nine small hydroelectric plants for a total capacity of 8.6 megawatts. In general, a VPP pulls together many small components—like rooftop solar, home batteries, and smart thermostats—into a single coordinated power system. The system responds to grid needs on demand, whether by making stored energy available or reducing energy consumption by smart devices during peak hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VPPs &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/virtual-power-plants-real-power&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;had a moment&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-2010s, but market conditions and the technology weren’t quite aligned for them to take off. Electricity demand &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65264&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wasn’t high enough&lt;/a&gt;, and existing sources—coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables—met demand and kept prices stable. Additionally, despite the costs of hardware like solar panels and batteries falling, the software to link and manage these resources lagged behind, and there wasn’t much financial incentive for it to catch up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But times have changed, and less than a decade later, the stars are aligning in VPPs’ favor. They’re hitting a deployment inflection point, and they could play a significant role in meeting energy demand over the next 5 to 10 years in a way that’s faster, cheaper, and greener than other solutions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Electricity Demand Is Growing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electricity demand in the United States is expected to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icf.com/insights/energy/electricity-demand-expected-to-grow&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;grow 25 percent&lt;/a&gt; by 2030 due to data center buildouts, electric vehicles, manufacturing, and electrification, according to estimates from technology consultant ICF International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a host of bottlenecks are making it hard to expand the grid. There’s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-data-centers&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;backlog of at least&lt;/a&gt; three to five years on new gas turbines. Hundreds of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/chart-the-us-clean-energy-backlog-is-getting-bigger-and-bigger&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gigawatts of renewables&lt;/a&gt; are languishing in interconnection queues, where there’s also a backlog of up to five years. On the delivery side, there’s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/transformer-shortage&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;transformer shortage&lt;/a&gt; that could take up to five years to resolve, and a dearth of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cleanenergygrid.org/new-report-reveals-u-s-transmission-buildout-lagging-far-behind-national-needs&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;transmission lines&lt;/a&gt;. This all adds up to a long, slow process to add generation and delivery capacity, and it’s not getting faster anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Fueling electric vehicles, electric heat, and data centers solely from traditional approaches would increase rates that are already too high,” says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-heavner-9a63b311/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Brad Heavner&lt;/a&gt;, the executive director of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://calssa.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;California Solar &amp; Storage Association&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter the vast network of resources that are already active and grid-connected—and the perfect storm of factors that make now the time to scale them. &lt;a href=&#34;https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/nasiri_adel.php&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Adel Nasiri&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of South Carolina, says variability of loads from data centers and electric vehicles has increased, as has deployment of grid-scale batteries and storage. There are more distributed energy resources available than there were before, and the last decade has seen advances in grid management using autonomous controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of it all, though, is the technology that stores and dispatches electricity on demand: batteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Advances in Battery Technology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years, battery prices have plummeted: the average &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lithium-ion battery pack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; price&lt;/a&gt; fell from US $715 per kilowatt-hour in 2014 to $115 per kWh in 2024. Their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1234-april-18-2022-volumetric-energy-density-lithium-ion-batteries&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;energy density&lt;/a&gt; has simultaneously increased thanks to a combination of materials advancements, design optimization of battery cells, and improvements in the packaging of battery systems, says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-gross-b4a86714/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Oliver Gross&lt;/a&gt;, a senior fellow in energy storage and electrification at automaker Stellantis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest improvements have come in batteries’ cathodes and electrolytes, with nickel-based cathodes starting to be used about a decade ago. “In many ways, the cathode limits the capacity of the battery, so by unlocking higher capacity cathode materials, we have been able to take advantage of the intrinsic higher capacity of anode materials,” says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregless/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Greg Less&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the University of Michigan’s Battery Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing the percentage of nickel in the cathode (relative to other metals) increases energy density because nickel can hold more lithium per gram than materials like cobalt or manganese, exchanging more electrons and participating more fully in the redox reactions that move lithium in and out of the battery. The same goes for silicon, which has become more common in anodes. However, there’s a trade-off: These materials cause more structural instability during the battery’s cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anode and cathode are surrounded by a liquid electrolyte. The electrolyte has to be electrically and chemically stable when exposed to the anode and cathode in order to avoid safety hazards like thermal runaway or fires and rapid degradation. “The real revolution has been the breakthroughs in chemistry to make the electrolyte stable against more reactive cathode materials to get the energy density up,” says Gross. Chemical compound additives—many of them based on sulfur and boron chemistry—for the electrolyte help create stable layers between it and the anode and cathode materials. “They form these protective layers very early in the manufacturing process so that the cell stays stable throughout its life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These advances have primarily been made on electric vehicle batteries, which differ from grid-scale batteries in that EVs are often parked or idle, while grid batteries are constantly connected and need to be ready to transfer energy. However, Gross says, “the same approaches that got our energy density higher in EVs can also be applied to optimizing grid storage. The materials might be a little different, but the methodologies are the same.” The most popular cathode material for grid storage batteries at the moment is lithium iron phosphate, or LFP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to these technical gains and dropping costs, a domino effect has been set in motion: The more batteries deployed, the cheaper they become, which fuels more deployment and creates positive feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regions that have experienced frequent blackouts—like parts of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.texastribune.org/2024/07/18/texas-energy-grid-power-outages-climate-change-infrastructure/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-11-06/edison-blacks-out-more-customers-to-stop-utility-sparked-fires&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/puerto-rico-earthquake-power-outages-prepa-news&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;—are a prime market for home batteries. Texas-based &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.basepowercompany.com/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Base Power&lt;/a&gt;, which raised $1 billion in Series C funding in October, installs batteries at customers’ homes and becomes their retail power provider, charging the batteries when excess wind or solar production makes prices cheap, and then selling that energy back to the grid when demand spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, however, still room for improvement. For wider adoption, says Nasiri, “the installed battery cost needs to get under $100 per kWh for large VPP deployments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improvements in VPP Software&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software infrastructure that once limited VPPs to pilot projects has matured into a robust digital backbone, making it feasible to operate VPPs at grid scale. Advances in AI are key: Many VPPs now use machine learning algorithms to predict load flexibility, solar and battery output, customer behavior, and grid stress events. This improves the dependability of a VPP’s capacity, which was historically a major concern for grid operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Close-up of a roof-top solar panel.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;b3240&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-a-roof-top-solar-panel.jpg?id=62288941&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;While solar panels have advanced, VPPs have been held back by a lack of similar advancement in the needed software until recently.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;Sunrun&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity and interoperability standards are still evolving. Interconnection processes and data visibility in many areas aren’t consistent, making it hard to monitor and coordinate distributed resources effectively. In short, while the technology and economics for VPPs are firmly in place, there’s work yet to be done aligning regulation, infrastructure, and market design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of technical and cost constraints, VPPs have long been held back by regulations that prevented them from participating in energy markets like traditional generators. SolarEdge recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251029315871/en/SolarEdge-Surpasses-500-MWh-of-Storage-in-Virtual-Power-Plants-Across-16-U.S.-States-Canada-and-Puerto-Rico&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; enrollment of more than 500 megawatt-hours of residential battery storage in its VPP programs. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamarasinensky/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tamara Sinensky&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s senior manager of grid services, says the biggest hurdle to achieving this milestone wasn’t technical—it was regulatory program design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California’s Demand Side Grid Support (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/demand-side-grid-support-program&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DSGS&lt;/a&gt;) program, launched in mid-2022, pays homes, businesses, and VPPs to reduce electricity use or discharge energy during grid emergencies. “We’ve seen a massive increase in our VPP enrollments primarily driven by the DSGS program,” says Sinensky. Similarly, Sunrun’s Northern California VPP delivered 535 megawatts of power from home-based batteries to the grid in July, and saw a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.utilitydive.com/news/sunrun-sees-400-growth-in-virtual-power-plant-participation/805169/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;400 percent increase&lt;/a&gt; in VPP participation from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ferc.gov/ferc-order-no-2222-explainer-facilitating-participation-electricity-markets-distributed-energy&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FERC Order 2222&lt;/a&gt;, issued in 2020, requires regional grid operators to allow VPPs to sell power, reduce load, or provide grid services directly to wholesale market operators, and get paid the same market price as a traditional power plant for those services. However, many states and grid regions don’t yet have a process in place to comply with the FERC order. And because utilities profit from grid expansion and not VPP deployment, they’re not incentivized to integrate VPPs into their operations. Utilities “view customer batteries as competition,” says Heavner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Nasiri, VPPs would have a meaningful impact on the grid if they achieve a penetration of 2 percent of the market’s peak power. “Larger penetration of up to 5 percent for up to 4 hours is required to have a meaningful capacity impact for grid planning and operation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, VPP operators have their work cut out for them in continuing to unlock the flexible capacity in homes, businesses, and EVs. Additional technical and policy advances could move VPPs from a niche reliability tool to a key power source and grid stabilizer for the energy tumult ahead.&lt;a href=&#34;#_msocom_2&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</div>

When he was growing up, no one in Chirgaon had a computer. His family owned a pharmacy, which Agrawal was expected to join after he graduated from high school. Instead, his uncle and older brother encouraged him to attend college and find his own passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He enjoyed mathematics and physics, and he decided to pursue a bachelor’s degree in statistics at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.allduniv.ac.in/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;University of Allahabad&lt;/a&gt;. After graduating in 1996, he pursued a master’s degree&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in statistics, statistical quality control, and operations research&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.isical.ac.in/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Indian Statistical Institute&lt;/a&gt; in Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While at the ISI, he saw a computer for the first time in the laboratory of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.isical.ac.in/~nikhil/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nikhil R.

He was so inspired by Pal’s work, he says, that he stayed on at the university to earn a second master’s degree, in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating in 2001, he joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt; as a senior software engineer working out of its Bengaluru office in India. He helped develop &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFolder&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iFolder&lt;/a&gt;, a storage platform that allows users across different computers to back up, access, and manage their files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After four years, Agrawal left Novell to join Microsoft as a software design engineer, working at the company’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/hyderabad-campus&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hyderabad campus&lt;/a&gt; in India. He was part of a team developing a system to upgrade Microsoft’s software from &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vista&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later, he was transferred to the group developing Bing, a replacement for Microsoft’s Live Search, which had been launched in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improving Microsoft’s search engine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live Search had a traffic rate of less than 2 percent and struggled to keep up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;’s faster-paced, more user-friendly system, Agrawal says. He was tasked with improving search results but, Agrawal says, he and his team didn’t have enough user search data to train their machine learning model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data for location-specific queries, such as nearby coffee shops or restaurants, was especially important, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome those challenges, the team used deterministic algorithms to create a more structured search. Such algorithms give the same answers for any query that uses the same specific terms. The process gets results by taking keywords—such as locations, dates, and prices—and finding them on webpages. To help the search engine understand what users need, Agrawal developed a query clarifier that asked them to refine their search. The machine learning tool then ranked the results from most to least relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test new features before they were launched, Agrawal and his team built an online A/B experimentation platform. Controlled tests were completed on different versions of the products, and the platform ran performance and user engagement metrics, then it produced a scorecard to show changes for updated features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing launched in 2009 and is now the world’s second-largest search engine, according to&lt;a href=&#34;https://blackraven.digital/the-rise-of-bing-and-how-it-differs-from-google/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; Black Raven&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout his 10 years of working on the system, Agrawal upgraded it. He also worked with the advertising department to improve Microsoft’s services on Bing. Ads relevant to a person’s search are listed among the search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The work seems easy,” Agrawal says, “but behind every search engine are hundreds of engineers powering ads, query formulations, rankings, relevance, and location detection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Testing products before launch &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agrawal was promoted to software development manager in 2010. Five years later he was transferred to Microsoft’s Seattle offices. At the time, the company was deploying new features for existing platforms without first testing them to ensure effectiveness. Instead, they measured their performance after release, Agrawal says, and that was wreaking havoc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He proposed using his online A/B experimentation platform on all Microsoft products, not just Bing. His supervisor approved the idea. In six months Agrawal and his team modified the tool for company-wide use. Thanks to the platform, he says, Microsoft was able to smoothly deploy up-to-date products to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After another two years, he was promoted to principal engineering manager of Microsoft Teams, which was facing issues with user experience, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many employees received between 50 and 100 messages a day—which became overwhelming for them,” Agrawal says. To lessen the stress, he led a team that developed the system’s first machine learning feature: Trending. It prioritized the five most important messages users should focus on. Agrawal also led the launch of incorporating emoji reactions, screen sharing, and video calls for Teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020 he was ready for new experiences, he says, and he left Microsoft to join Amazon as an engineering leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improved Amazon shopping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agrawal led an Amazon team that manually collected information about products from the company’s retail catalog to create a glossary. The data, which included product dimensions, color, and manufacturer, was used to standardize the language found in product descriptions to keep listings more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is especially important when it comes to third-party sellers, he notes. Sellers listing a product had been entering as much or as little information as they wanted. Agrawal built a system that automatically suggests language from the glossary as the seller types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also developed an AI algorithm that utilizes the glossary’s terminology to refine search results based on what a user types into the search bar. When a shopper types “red mixer,” for example, the algorithm lists products under the search bar that match the description. The shopper can then click on a product from the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023 the retailer’s catalog became too large for Agrawal and his team to collect information manually, so they built an AI tool to do it for them. It became the foundation for Amazon’s Catalog AI system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After gathering information about products from around the Web, Catalog AI uses large language models to update Amazon listings with missing information, correct errors, and rewrite titles and product specifications to make them clearer for the customer, Agrawal says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company expects the AI tool to increase sales this year by US $7.5 billion, according to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/amazons-ai-wants-own-online-shopping-data&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fox News report&lt;/a&gt; in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Finding purpose at IEEE&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Agrawal joined IEEE last December, he has been elevated to senior member and has become an active volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being part of IEEE has opened doors for collaboration, mentorship, and professional growth,” he says. “IEEE has strengthened both my technical knowledge and my leadership skills, helping me progress in my career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agrawal is the social media chair of the IEEE Seattle Section. He is also vice chair of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cis.ieee.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IEEE Computational Intelligence Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a workshop cochair for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://attend.ieee.org/neweraai25/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IEEE New Era AI World Leaders Summit&lt;/a&gt;, which was held from 5 to 7 December in Seattle. The event brought together government and industry leaders, as well as researchers and innovators working on AI, intelligent devices, &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-weapons&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;unmanned aerial vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, and similar technologies. They explored how new tools could be used in cybersecurity, the medical field, and national disaster rescue missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agrawal says he stays up to date on cutting-edge technologies by peer-reviewing 15 IEEE journals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The organization plays a very important role in bringing authenticity to anything that it does,” he says. “If a journal article has the IEEE logo, you can believe that it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-research-integrity-process&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;thoroughly and diligently reviewed&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</div>

          <div class="tag" style="margin-top:6px">&lt;img src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/collage-with-chess-game-vintage-machine-and-map-against-yellow-and-black-background.png?id=62293844&amp;amp;width=2000&amp;amp;height=1500&amp;amp;coordinates=65%2C0%2C65%2C0&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On 18 November 1844,&lt;/strong&gt; the Washington Chess Club challenged its counterparts in Baltimore to a match. Two teams were organized, and at 4 p.m. on 26 November, the first game commenced with three consulting members to a side. Washington began conventionally, pushing a pawn to the center of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61533/pg61533-images.html#CHESS&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the board&lt;/a&gt;. Baltimore immediately responded by mirroring the move. But this was unlike any chess game ever played before. The Baltimoreans were still in Baltimore, the Washingtonians were still in Washington, D.C, 60 kilometers away, and they were playing by electrical telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successive moves were transmitted over the new Baltimore–Washington telegraph line, the first in the United States, which Samuel Morse and company had inaugurated in May of that year with the message “&lt;a href=&#34;https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object/nmah_713485&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;What hath God wrought&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Black and white photo of a man in 19th century garb standing, with his hand on a mechanical apparatus.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;e791e&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-man-in-19th-century-garb-standing-with-his-hand-on-a-mechanical-apparatus.jpg?id=62293850&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Samuel F.B. Morse pushed for the first U.S. telegraph, which connected Washington, D.C., to Baltimore, Md.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.loc.gov/item/2001700118/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mathew B. Brady/Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One chess game led to another, and play continued on and off for days. Records of the games are incomplete and sometimes inconsistent—181 years later, it’s unclear who exactly dreamt up chess over wire and why. But thanks in part to historical documents at the Smithsonian Institution, we know enough about the people involved and the operation of the early telegraph to have a sense of the proceedings. We know that Morse would &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61533/pg61533-images.html#LETTER_19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cite chess&lt;/a&gt; in lobbying Congress to fund the extension of the telegraphic network to New York via Philadelphia. And we know that there was much more chess by telegraph to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not simply a novelty or a one-off tech demo, telegraph chess eventually became a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/23788123&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;well-known, joked-about trend&lt;/a&gt; in the United States and Britain, writes historian &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/sites/cas/ueber_uns/Postdoctoral-Fellows/cas-postdoc-alumni/Simone_M__ller_Pohl/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Simone Müller-Pohl&lt;/a&gt;. Chess by telegraph also prefigured chess played through other means of telecommunications. There are records of recreational and serious games played over radio, on telephone lines, satellite, and through online interfaces including forums, email, and dedicated live services. Most recently, chess has evolved into an esport. Earlier this year, chess joined the likes of &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; at the&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.esportsworldcup.com/en/news/chess-joins-ewc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; 2025 Esports World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Color photo of a man wearing headphones and seated at a computer, staring at a display of a chess board. &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;3e0c7&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-a-man-wearing-headphones-and-seated-at-a-computer-staring-at-a-display-of-a-chess-board.jpg?id=62293851&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Last August, chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen won the first ever Chess Esports World Cup.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;Esports World Cup&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of adults worldwide who play chess regularly is often estimated at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.un.org/en/observances/world-chess-day&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;around 600 million&lt;/a&gt;, and many of them use whatever means available to play games across long distances with friends, rivals, and strangers. Indeed, the 1,500-year-old game and the latest in telecommunications always seem to find each other, starting just months after the first telegraph was built in the United States, when chess went electric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Birth of Chess by Telegraph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Baltimore–Washington telegraph was financed in 1843 with US $30,000 (about $1.3 million today) &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/senate-stories/morses-telegraph-in-the-capitol.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;appropriated by Congress&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of Morse’s business partner, &lt;a href=&#34;https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1860&amp;amp;context=mainehistoryjournal&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Francis O.J. Smith&lt;/a&gt;, who had supported the project in 1838 while still a sitting congressman from Maine. By late 1844, a bill to extend the line to New York was in front of the U.S. House of Representatives. In at least one way, drawing the attention of legislators to the new line was relatively easy—the Washington end moved back and forth between the Capitol building and&lt;a href=&#34;https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/headquarters-sites.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; the post office&lt;/a&gt;, near the present-day National Portrait Gallery. If you were a lawmaker in Washington at the time, the telegraph would’ve been hard to miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rblad-ieee_in_content&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps they needed more persuading. Orrin S. Wood, a telegraph operator, thought so. On 5 December 1844, Wood wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://reader.library.cornell.edu/docviewer/digital?id=ezra0002_4#page/12/mode/1up&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; to his brother-in-law, engineer Ezra Cornell, who had worked on the line and would go on to cofound Western Union:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have had considerable excitement in playing chess between this place and Baltimore for the last 2 or 3 weeks.…I am inclined to think that Congress will do something for Prof Morse as very many of them appear to be very much interested with [chess].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week later, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61533/pg61533-images.html#LETTER_19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Morse wrote&lt;/a&gt; to George M. Bibb, Secretary of the Treasury, to lobby for the funding. The telegraph could relay congressional news, presidential convention results, or the whereabouts of wanted criminals, he argued. He also played the chess card:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Two brief hand-written notes related to a telegraph chess match between the Washington Chess Club and its counterpart in Baltimore. &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;3865a&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-brief-hand-written-notes-related-to-a-telegraph-chess-match-between-the-washington-chess-club-and-its-counterpart-in-baltimo.jpg?id=62293858&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;On 18 November 1844, the Washington Chess Club challenged Baltimore to a game of telegraph chess. One telegraph operator asked his counterpart, “Are you tired of checkers?”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217214&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Smithsonian Institution Archives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To show the variety of the operations of the telegraph, a game of draughts [checkers], and several games of chess, have been played between the cities of Baltimore and Washington, with the same ease as if the players were seated at the same table.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chess had even been played on rainy nights, he noted. The telegraph’s continued operation in both inclement weather and darkness compared favorably with &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-the-count-of-monte-cristo-can-teach-us-about-cybersecurity&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;optical telegraphy&lt;/a&gt;. Such systems, popular in France, consisted of regularly spaced flag towers that relayed messages by semaphore; they were costly to build and operate and only worked in daylight and good weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Morse played up people’s interest in telegraphic chess, the game itself didn’t obviously begin with promotional intent. It began with checkers. We know this because Morse’s associate Alfred Vail kept a “Journal of the Magnetic Telegraph between Washington and Baltimore” (now part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217214&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vail Telegraph Collection&lt;/a&gt; at the Smithsonian) in which he meticulously recorded messages sent over the wire for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;A hand-written note dated Nov 26 records chess moves in a game between Washington, D.C, and Baltimore &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;d7781&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-hand-written-note-dated-nov-26-records-chess-moves-in-a-game-between-washington-d-c-and-baltimore.jpg?id=62293859&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Notes from a 26 November 1844 chess game record players’ moves, as well as other snippets of information, such as “I sent tea for Mr. Vail by 5 o’clock train.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217214&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Smithsonian Institution Archives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 15 November 1844, Vail in Washington instructed Henry J. Rogers in Baltimore to “get a checkerboard and let us play a game tomorrow morning.” Vail promised to send instructions by regular mail on the five o’clock train. At first confused, Rogers came up with the idea of using numbered squares to communicate locations on the board. Later that day, Rogers announced that John Wills, a journalist with the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baltimore Patriot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, would play in his place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, before the checkers game began, Vail recorded a telegraphic exchange between himself and Rogers, in which Vail suggests the game is for private enjoyment, and he would prefer that Wills—a reporter—not write about it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you think the game any advantage R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What game V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Checkers R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amusement V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t you think people will make remarks R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not if it is done by ourselves V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;yes have you any objections to Wills R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;none if he does not publish it V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;yes R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wills was thoroughly impressed with the technology, calling it “another wonder of the age,” according to Rogers. And so the telegraphers agreed that he could publish an account of the game, which perhaps was Vail’s hope all along. The story was still being prepared for publication on 18 November when Vail tapped, “The Washington Chess Club challenge Baltimore to a game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How about a Nice Game of Chess?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vail’s 1845 book about the telegraph includes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61533/pg61533-images.html#CHESS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a brief report&lt;/a&gt; on chess. He writes that in the Washington–Baltimore match, seven games were played, totalling 686 moves “transmitted without a single mistake or interruption.” These details reappear in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.loc.gov/item/05025200/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of the First American Chess Congress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which called the Baltimore–Washington games the first telegraphic chess match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Black and white photo of a man in fancy 19th century dress, seated and holding a walking stick.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;548b8&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-man-in-fancy-19th-century-dress-seated-and-holding-a-walking-stick.jpg?id=62293860&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Alfred Vail, Morse’s associate, was instrumental in organizing the first telegraph chess match and kept detailed notes on messages sent over the line.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;Zoom Historical/Alamy&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;How did the games actually unfold? While many of the rules and conventions of chess would be familiar to modern chess players, the games were unusual in other ways. At the time, the standard way of describing chess moves was descriptive notation, says &lt;a href=&#34;https://new.uschess.org/author/john-mccrary&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;John McCrary&lt;/a&gt;, a former president of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://new.uschess.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;United States Chess Federation&lt;/a&gt; who maintains a collection of some 100 chess books from &lt;a href=&#34;https://chesscollectorsinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/rare-chess-book-collecting.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;before 1900&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, “pawn to queen’s bishop’s four” described moving a pawn in front of the bishop on the queen’s side of the board to the fourth row from the bottom.&lt;p&gt;Before the electrical telegraph, such descriptions would have been used in correspondence chess, played by mail. And &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/TheOxfordCompanionToChessFirstEditionByDavidHooperKennethWhyld/page/n355/mode/2up&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oxford Companion to Chess&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1984) describes a proposed 1823 match between France and England that intended to use semaphore telegraph, although the notation used was either never planned or has been lost to time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Vail and Rogers used a system that assigned a unique number to each of the 64 squares. So “pawn to queen’s bishop’s four” would have been rendered as “11 to 27.” Though the game itself can be remarkably complex, that system allowed individual moves to be communicated simply. “The exchange of information in chess is relatively low,” says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-kazdan-ba92968/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;David Kazdan&lt;/a&gt;, an engineer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://case.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Case Western Reserve University&lt;/a&gt; who has recently overseen a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.arrl.org/news/view/using-amateur-radio-to-play-chess&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;renewed collaboration&lt;/a&gt; between the school’s radio and chess clubs. “You don’t need much of a communication channel to play chess.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Two hand-drawn grids labeled \u201ccheckers\u201d and \u201ccheckers &amp;amp; chess,\u201d with numbers in different squares. &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;2e716&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-hand-drawn-grids-labeled-u201ccheckers-u201d-and-u201ccheckers-chess-u201d-with-numbers-in-different-squares.jpg?id=62293861&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;To represent the positions on their telegraph chess board, Alfred Vail and Henry Rogers assigned a unique number to each of the 64 squares.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217214&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Smithsonian Institution Archives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vail’s book logs the moves for two of the chess games, and both accounts include an illegal move—probably errors that were introduced later. The accounts in Vail’s telegraphic journal, on the other hand, appear accurate, and even include a real-time correction of one move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;A list titled First Game of Chess that records the chess moves made by the W, for white, player and the B, for black, player. &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;33085&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-list-titled-first-game-of-chess-that-records-the-chess-moves-made-by-the-w-for-white-player-and-the-b-for-black-player.jpg?id=62293864&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;In the first game of telegraph chess, White was defeated.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_PGw8AAAAYAAJ/page/n1/mode/2up&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Vail’s journal, Washington claims the white pieces, but close examination shows that Washington either played the first move as black, or the board was mirrored left to right. At the time, the white pieces did not always take the&lt;a href=&#34;https://new.uschess.org/news/evolution-modern-chess-rules-white-moves-first&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; first move&lt;/a&gt;. The sides also agreed to a limit of 10 minutes per move, even though time controls weren’t common in chess, and the chess clock had not yet been invented. And while Vail wanted “first rate players,” McCrary calls the overall play weak, with a poor understanding of the long-term planning needed to coordinate all of the pieces. Both teams also made tactical errors. For example, in the second game, Washington overlooked that one of their pawns was overworked defending two other pieces simultaneously, watched as Baltimore captured one of the pieces, and elected not to retaliate in order to continue defending a more valuable knight. “Even with changing conventions of that time, what was there in the description was atypical,” says McCrary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;ieee-inbody-related&#34;&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/chess-computer-1920&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;This 1920 Chess Automaton Was Wired to Win&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teams took a break during the first game and then reconvened on 28 November. With a pawn in position to advance to the last row, where it would be “promoted”—that is, replaced by a more dangerous piece of the player’s choice—Baltimore swept in with its queen and readied checkmate in one move. Unable to salvage the game, Washington resigned. “Ha ha,” wrote Rogers. “Ha ha,” responded Vail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no record of overall standings, and no winner was declared between the two cities after all games had been played.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Tech of Telegraph Chess&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By today’s standards, the hardware that relayed the moves was relatively simple, mainly consisting of a battery, a switch, and a magnet. “It’s not all that different from a doorbell,” says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.albany.edu/history/faculty/david-hochfelder&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;David Hochfelder&lt;/a&gt;, a historian at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.albany.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;State University of New York at Albany&lt;/a&gt; who has studied the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/3173/telegraph-america-1832-1920&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;early American telegraph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laying the line between the two cities had been difficult, with costly delays after failed attempts to bury the cable and to use cheaper noninsulated wire. Eventually, overhead insulated copper wire was strung the distance between poles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Black and white photo of a tabletop apparatus with metal gears.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;d725b&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-tabletop-apparatus-with-metal-gears.jpg?id=62293867&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;On 24 May 1844, this telegraph register received the first message sent by telegraph: “What hath God wrought.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;AP&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years before the chess match, Morse had considered a messaging system that used only numbers, which corresponded to set words or phrases listed in a code book. But he soon realized that a practical communications service would need an alphabetic component to spell out proper names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to Morse’s eponymous code, which assigns a series of short and long signals to different alphanumeric characters. By tapping on a key, telegraph operators would interrupt a battery-powered current that ran the length of the telegraph wire. At the other end, an electromagnet moved a stylus, pen, or pencil, to mark a piece of paper with the corresponding dots and dashes, which an operator would then read. (The sounder, which turned the signals into audible sounds, hadn’t yet been invented.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;ieee-inbody-related&#34;&gt;Related: &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/morse-codes-vanquished-competitor-the-dial-telegraph&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Morse Code’s Vanquished Competitor: The Dial Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the chess games, the telegraph operators occasionally asked each other how many people were in the room. At times, a dozen kibitzers looked on. At others, only the rotating cast of chess players and telegraph operators was present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Telegraph Chess Moves On&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Baltimore–Washington telegraph line was an immediate hit with a general public that embraced popular science through lectures and popular books and magazines. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was founded in 1845, for example. But people were more curious to see the telegraph at work than they were to use its services, even though the line operated &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/first-week-of-the-telegraph/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;free of charge&lt;/a&gt; for the first year. “Operators tended to show its capabilities rather than handling actual message traffic,” says Hochfelder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of activity is sometimes evident in the telegraph journal. Many of the messages are purely functional (“I am ready,” “stop 30 minutes”); simple greetings; notifications of letters sent and received; or requests for daily newspapers. The Baltimore end of the telegraph was in the Mt. Clare station of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://preservationmaryland.org/this-day-in-history-chartering-of-the-bo-railroad/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;B&amp;amp;O railroad&lt;/a&gt;, and the telegraph line ran alongside the tracks. Mail delivered by train took half a day door to door, says Hochfelder, and the telegraph offered little practical advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 5 December 1844, Rogers wrote to Vail:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hear from several sources that we are making rather an unfavorable impression with the religious part of the community, and I am under the impression if we continue after the present party is through that we will be injured more than any benefit might or can be derived from it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact nature of the religious community’s complaint with telegraph chess is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Morse wrote to Vail on the day of the first chess game that he “was much pleased with your game of drafts,” he came to feel that chess was too &lt;a href=&#34;https://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1926CableChess/index.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;frivolous&lt;/a&gt; for the telegraph, as noted by the chess writer Tim Harding in his &lt;a href=&#34;https://mcfarlandbooks.com/product/correspondence-chess-in-britain-and-ireland-1824-1987/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correspondence Chess in Britain and Ireland, 1824–1987&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (McFarland, 2011)&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Whatever the reasons, it appears that after 17 December 1844, no more chess was played on the line. And in the end, Congress didn’t fund a telegraphic connection to New York, nor did it acquire perpetual rights to the telegraph, in part because Morse’s business partner had other designs, says Hochfelder. The Baltimore–Washington line operated under the auspices of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/telegraph.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Postal Service&lt;/a&gt; from 1845 to 1847, when funding ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Two black and white photos.

Over the next few years, companies built local lines and networks to connect cities across the country. Most notably, Ezra Cornell’s Western Union completed a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-transcontinental-telegraph.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;transcontinental telegraph in 1861&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually became a monopoly in the United States. Ordinary people rarely used the telegraph, says Hochfelder, but it transformed industries such as finance and journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, telegraph chess was taken up elsewhere. In 1845, for example, a match between London and Gosport, England, involved inventor &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/morse-codes-vanquished-competitor-the-dial-telegraph&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Charles Wheatstone&lt;/a&gt; and chess master Howard Staunton. But it would take another few decades for telechess to become more widespread, with prominent club matches &lt;a href=&#34;https://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1926CableChess/index.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;played over telegraph&lt;/a&gt; from the 1890s into the 1920s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-level chess competitions tend to be held in person, but games have been played remotely from time to time. For example, in 1965, U.S. grandmaster Bobby Fischer relayed his moves &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0UJ52Gw5W4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;by teletype&lt;/a&gt; over telephone lines from New York City to Havana, after the U.S. State Department prevented his attending a tournament there. And in 1999, a couple of years after losing a rematch to the IBM supercomputer &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-ibms-deep-blue-beat-world-champion-chess-player-garry-kasparov&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Deep Blue&lt;/a&gt;, world champion Garry Kasparov played a promotional game against a team representing “the world,” which consulted on moves via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.microsoft.com/source/1999/10/25/world-chess-champion-garry-kasparov-defeats-world-team-in-kasparov-vs-the-world-on-msn-com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Microsoft forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Color photo of a man in a suite sitting next to a computer with a large display of a chess board. &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;e6618&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-a-man-in-a-suite-sitting-next-to-a-computer-with-a-large-display-of-a-chess-board.jpg?id=62293870&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;In a promotional game in 1999, Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov played an online game against “the world.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;Jeff Christensen/Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the internet has taken telecom chess to fabulous new heights, with one site alone, &lt;a href=&#34;https://chess.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;chess.com&lt;/a&gt;, often hosting up to 20 million games a day. Indeed, the growth in online play has sometimes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chess.com/blog/CHESScom/chess-is-booming-and-our-servers-are-struggling&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;stretched&lt;/a&gt; the capacities of the servers and the engineers who maintain them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why have technologists taken the opportunity to play chess using so many generations of telecommunications? It may simply be that chess is popular, and by its nature can actually be played with short messages and perfect information, unlike soccer or poker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is there something more, maybe a natural affinity? “There are similarities in thinking processes [between] engineering design, and the sort of puzzle solving that a chess game involves,” says Kazdan of Case Western Reserve. The connection may be one-sided. “Many engineers like chess. I’m not sure many chess players like engineering.” &lt;span class=&#34;ieee-end-mark&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</div>

A strike by telephone operators prevented exhibitors from linking their terminals to off-site computers, as union-sympathetic workers refused to wire up the necessary connections. Companies’ displays were effectively dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25&#34; rel=&#34;float: left;&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Book cover for ReadMe: A Bookish History of Computing from Electronic Brains to Everything Machines by W.

With this hardware in place, the youngsters dialed in to an off-site minicomputer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teenagers called themselves the RESISTORS, a retronym (they picked the moniker first and then matched words to the letters) for “Radically Emphatic Students Interested in Science, Technology, Or Research Studies.” The trade publication &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computerworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; gave the RESISTORS front-page billing—“Students Steal Show as Conference Opens”—and noted how the group drew a “fascinated crowd” of computer professionals. A reporter even suggested that the RESISTORS represented the vanguard of a small-scale social movement as the teens sought to engage with their counterparts from “underprivileged areas of Trenton” and introduce them to personal computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Color photo of a young boy seated in front of a large computer, with other computer equipment in the background. &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;73651&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-a-young-boy-seated-in-front-of-a-large-computer-with-other-computer-equipment-in-the-background.jpg?id=62293684&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;RESISTOR Peter Eichenberger works on a DEC PDP-8 computer, which Claude Kagan convinced the company to donate to the group.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;Chuck Ehrlich&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the modern history of computing, a story about a small cohort of teens “playing” with computers might seem tangential. But the previously untold history of the RESISTORS highlights the fact that, years before there were machines called personal computers, some people regularly accessed computers for activities unrelated to their professional lives. Motives varied, but entertainment as well as the display of technical prowess mattered. Just as important, the story of the RESISTORS expands our sense of the hobbyist community beyond later and better-known groups like the Bay Area’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/personal-computers/17/312&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Homebrew Computer Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rblad-ieee_in_content&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An early computer club for teens &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer than 70 kids claimed membership in the RESISTORS over the group’s roughly decade-long existence. Nonetheless, a surprisingly large number of them went on to have careers in technology and science. Two members wrote books about computing that would sell millions of copies. Another member cofounded &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cisco.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cisco Systems&lt;/a&gt;, which got its start manufacturing Internet routers and other networking hardware and is now a multibillion-dollar business. Others became college professors or professional programmers. And starting around 1969, the RESISTORS became linked to computer pioneer &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/ted-nelson-on-what-modern-programmers-can-learn-from-the-past&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Ted Nelson&lt;/a&gt; (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An engineer named &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.computer.org/profiles/claude-kagan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Claude Kagan &lt;/a&gt;was the nucleus around which the RESISTORS first organized. Born in 1924 in Orval, France, Kagan moved to the United States as a teen, served in the army, and earned an M.S. from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cornell.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt; in 1950. He took a position with Western Electric, the manufacturing arm of AT&amp;amp;T, and in 1958, he moved to Hopewell Township, N.J., a short drive from Princeton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Black and white photo of men in suits talking and sitting around a square table. &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;74fe8&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-men-in-suits-talking-and-sitting-around-a-square-table.jpg?id=62293590&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Electrical engineer Claude Kagan [second from left] encouraged the RESISTORS to learn computing, using the large collection of used equipment stored in his barn. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;Chuck Ehrlich&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagan’s specialty was high-level computer languages, such as Fortran and BASIC, in which programmers write code that is largely independent of the particular type of computer. He was also an inveterate collector of old computers and other electronics, which he stored in a large red barn on his property that was also home to some donkeys and malamutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chuck Ehrlich, one of the original RESISTORS and later an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, recalls that in late 1966, he and a small group of “brainy social outcasts” were looking for some sort of clubhouse. The kids weren’t interested in smoking pot or social protests, and they were disenchanted with the science classes offered at their local schools. But they were into electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagan knew one of the teens’ fathers and offered to let the group use his barn. They soon discovered Kagan’s collection of artifacts, including a surplus IBM paper tape punch, some analog telephone equipment, and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/flexo/tour.shtml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Friden Flexowriter&lt;/a&gt; (a kind of heavy-duty typewriter that could be linked to a computer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;A color photo of a 1950s mainframe computer in a room filled with assorted junk. &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;93678&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-color-photo-of-a-1950s-mainframe-computer-in-a-room-filled-with-assorted-junk.jpg?id=62293697&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;A color photo of a 1950s mainframe computer in a room filled with assorted junk. &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;cf545&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-color-photo-of-a-1950s-mainframe-computer-in-a-room-filled-with-assorted-junk.jpg?id=62299217&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;The first computer the RESISTORS used was a Burroughs Datatron 205 mainframe, which occupied most of two walls in Kagan’s barn.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;David Gesswein&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the main attraction for the teens were Kagan’s computers. The most imposing of these was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://tjsawyer.com/B205home.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Burroughs Datatron 205&lt;/a&gt;, a computer first manufactured in the mid-1950s and based on vacuum tubes. The enormous machine weighed several tons, and stories circulated about how Kagan had borrowed a tractor trailer to heroically transport the behemoth from Michigan to New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only slightly less imposing was an inoperable &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3data.computerhistory.org/brochures/packardbell.hycomp250.1961.102646194.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Packard Bell PB250&lt;/a&gt;, a refrigerator-size computer of more recent vintage that the teens managed to get working. Kagan also allowed the teens to connect to his employer’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/minicomputers/11/331&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DEC PDP-8&lt;/a&gt; machine via teletype over phone lines so they could run programs written in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.resistors.org/index.php/The_RESISTORS_and_Trac&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TRAC&lt;/a&gt; (Text Reckoning And Compiling). Developed starting in 1959 by computer scientist &lt;a href=&#34;https://garfield.library.upenn.edu/commentaries/tsv11(06)p09y19970317.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Calvin Mooers&lt;/a&gt;, TRAC was an efficient language amenable to being run on machines that had relatively little memory. The teens were fond of connecting to the off-site computer and accessing a version of Joseph Weizenbaum’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/365153.365168&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ELIZA chatbot&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to work with computers interactively and in real time was generally unavailable to nonprofessional computer users at the time. Kagan eventually persuaded the Digital Equipment Corp. to donate a PDP-8—no trivial gift, as new models sold for US $15,000 or more—which the RESISTORS worked with in the barn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Black and white photo of a donkey peering out of a barn window at a seated young man adjusting some equipment.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;909ed&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-donkey-peering-out-of-a-barn-window-at-a-seated-young-man-adjusting-some-equipment.jpg?id=62302124&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;One of the donkeys in Claude Kagan’s barn looks on as RESISTOR Doug Timbie works on some equipment.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;John A. Pietras/The Evening Times; Trenton Free Public Library&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bargain Kagan struck with the RESISTORS was unusual for several reasons. First, Kagan was gay, a fact that the teens (and their parents) were aware of but which, by all accounts, bothered no one. When the Hopewell Valley Jaycee-ettes held a house tour in April 1966, the brochure encouraged people to visit Kagan’s “unique bachelor setting” that he shared with artist George Furnish. Furnish passed away around the time the RESISTORS were forming, and the grieving Kagan assumed multiple roles for the group: guru, mentor, publicity agent, and landlord. Kagan provided the space, while the teens were responsible for maintaining both it and the equipment as well as covering the cost of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most amateur computer clubs of the era were masculine spaces, but photographs of the RESISTORS almost always show one or more young women working at a terminal or solving a programming problem. When it came to deciding whose turn it was to use a machine, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cals.cornell.edu/people/jean-hunter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jean Hunter&lt;/a&gt;—later a professor of biological and environmental engineering at Cornell—likened it to social time-sharing that required “beating people over the head to make them give you a turn.” &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.johnlevine.com/about.phtml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;John R. Levine&lt;/a&gt;, who was a RESISTOR before studying computer science at Yale and later coauthoring the bestseller &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dummies.com/book/technology/internet-basics/the-internet-for-dummies-14th-edition-281740/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internet for Dummies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, recalled, “We were so nerdy that it didn’t occur to us that girls [would] be any different in terms of what they could do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also efforts to recruit African American teens from schools in Trenton. One of these kids, Joseph Tulloch, provided quirky, Dr. Seuss-like illustrations for a programming manual that Kagan and the teens assembled and published. Tulloch later became a programmer for the state of New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New members were initiated into the group by having an omega sign, the engineer’s symbol for electrical resistance, drawn on their face with a Magic Marker (these were teenagers after all). One of the first things a new member would learn was how to use TRAC to write programs. For his part, Kagan held a dim view of traditional learning as practiced in local classrooms. He instead insisted that the RESISTORS learn by doing. The group’s pedagogical approach came from the African American motto “Each one, teach one.” As one member recalled, “If you want to teach someone how to do something, you had to let them sit at the keyboard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RESISTORS’ location in the Princeton area contributed to their success. Several members had parents employed at nearby technology companies, such as AT&amp;amp;T and RCA. Others, such as Nat Kuhn, had parents who worked at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.princeton.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt;. Kuhn’s father was Thomas Kuhn, a historian and author of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/thomas-kuhn-structure-scientific-revolutions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1962), the landmark book that introduced “paradigm shift” into the vernacular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;A black and white photo of a young boy who is smiling and pointing a pen device at a computer screen. &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;ce0d7&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-black-and-white-photo-of-a-young-boy-who-is-smiling-and-pointing-a-pen-device-at-a-computer-screen.jpg?id=62293602&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Twelve-year-old Nat Kuhn was just 10 when he joined the RESISTORS. “I was super geeky,” he later recalled. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;David Fox&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a kid, Nat built devices from hobbyist electronics kits with his father, a former physicist. Nat joined the RESISTORS after attending an open house the group sponsored in February 1968 at the Princeton Junior Museum. He was just 10 years old at the time. “I was super geeky,” he recalled, “and the computer became my hobby and obsession. You could understand things through it and make things happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after Nat had his face inked with an omega sign, another person, much older but just as passionate about personal computing, started showing up at Claude Kagan’s barn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ted Nelson and the birth of hypertext&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ted Nelson had majored in philosophy at Swarthmore College, graduating in 1959, and then studied sociology at the University of Chicago and later Harvard, where he took his first computer course. Nelson’s 2010 autobiography includes a whole chapter, titled “The Epiphany of Ted Nelson,” about this revelatory experience. When he realized that the computer, instead of a dreary number-crunching device, “could be whatever it was programmed to be,” his “world exploded.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;A person stands at a 1970s printer, holding a paper while wearing a white shirt and striped tie.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;e4cce&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-person-stands-at-a-1970s-printer-holding-a-paper-while-wearing-a-white-shirt-and-striped-tie.jpg?id=62299163&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Ted Nelson met the RESISTORS in the late 1960s, when he was developing his ideas around hypertext and globally interconnected networks for publishing.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;Ted Nelson&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelson had a penchant for writing, and so an even bigger revelation was that computers could handle text by manipulating, storing, printing, and, above all, displaying it on screens. And, if this could be done with text, it could probably also be done with images and sound. “The future of mankind was at the computer screen,” he decided, as the “interactive computer would become the workplace of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally profound for Nelson was recognizing that once a person had text on a computer screen, they could use it to construct parallel, nonsequential textual passages. These word assemblages could then be linked to one another or branch off in entirely new directions—a farsighted idea for the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1964, Nelson accepted a teaching position at Vassar College, where his new colleagues invited him to describe how the future of work and artistic creativity would happen on computer screens. In the promotional flyer for the talk, he introduced a new word: hypertext.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Black and white drawing of a Superman-like figure flying toward a rectangular opening, with the words Dream Machine at top.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;f50f9&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-drawing-of-a-superman-like-figure-flying-toward-a-rectangular-opening-with-the-words-dream-machine-at-top.jpg?id=62299307&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Some of the ideas that Ted Nelson discussed with the RESISTORS later turned up in Nelson’s opus Computer Lib/Dream Machines.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;Microsoft Press&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Nelson defined it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/800197.806036&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a 1965 paper&lt;/a&gt;, hypertext meant “a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper.” Almost any topic could, in principle, be represented on a computer screen with “links” connecting one entry to another, along with annotation, footnotes, and summaries, while also including “every feature a novelist or absent-minded professor could want.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;ieee-inbody-related&#34;&gt;RELATED VIDEO: &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/ted-nelson-on-what-modern-programmers-can-learn-from-the-past&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ted Nelson on What Modern Programmers Can Learn From the Past&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelson imagined that his system of information storage, retrieval, and documentation could “grow indefinitely,” containing more and more of the world’s knowledge while revealing important connections between all of the entries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelson soon quit Vassar and started raising money and his professional profile. His goal was to design and implement a universal text handling, publishing, and globally connected electronic library system, which he named &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xanadu.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Project Xanadu&lt;/a&gt;, from Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan.” (It’s also the name of Charles Foster Kane’s mansion in Orson Welles’s 1941 classic, &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.) Xanadu would turn into Nelson’s lifelong obsession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A convergence of art and computers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The catalyst that brought Nelson together with Claude Kagan and the RESISTORS wasn’t some new computer but an avant-garde art show. In the fall of 1970, a lavish new exhibition titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.artforum.com/events/software-234492/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; opened at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://thejewishmuseum.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jewish Museum&lt;/a&gt; in New York City. Museum director &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/03/archives/jewish-museum-finds-its-new-director-brooklynborn-karl-katz-in.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Karl Katz&lt;/a&gt; handpicked the influential art theorist &lt;a href=&#34;https://monoskop.org/Jack_Burnham&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jack Burnham&lt;/a&gt; to curate the show. Burnham, in turn, was inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://museum.dataart.com/short-stories/norbert-wiener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Norbert Wiener&lt;/a&gt;’s cybernetic concepts and wanted to explore how conceptual artists might experiment with new computing technologies, such as “real-time computing” and “interactivity,” in a gallery setting. The exhibition gave thousands of visitors an opportunity to see, and in some cases use, minicomputers, teletype equipment, high-speed copy machines, and closed-circuit television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Black and white photo shows 3 teenagers looking at a 1960s computer terminal.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;0b1ac&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-shows-3-teenagers-looking-at-a-1960s-computer-terminal.jpg?id=62293557&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Black and white photo shows a large room decorated with hand-written posters and people seated at tables. &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;d247c&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-shows-a-large-room-decorated-with-hand-written-posters-and-people-seated-at-tables.jpg?id=62293556&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;When the Jewish Museum launched an ambitious art and tech exhibition in 1970, members of the RESISTORS collaborated with artists and provided tech support. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;The Jewish Museum&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A contributor to the show and its technical adviser, Ted Nelson recruited the RESISTORS to help him and some of the artists. As he later wrote in his influential 1974 book &lt;a href=&#34;https://computerlibbook.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computer Lib/Dream Machines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Some people are too proud to ask children for information. This is dumb. Information is where you find it.” For Agnes Denes, a Hungarian-born conceptual artist, the teens coded a minicomputer to animate triangles on a screen for a piece called &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trigonal Ballet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. For conceptual artist Carl Fernbach-Flarsheim, the teens used the I Ching to program a piece called &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conceptual Typewriter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; A visitor could select one of several buttons, such as “the silent” (represented by a circle) or “the providing” (illustrated by sheaves of wheat), and then use a light pen to alter the image. Both artists provided the initial ideas, but the RESISTORS executed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelson, working with programmer Ned Woodman, contributed a piece titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Labyrinth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Running on a PDP-8 that DEC provided, &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Labyrinth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was explained as “the first public demonstration of a hypertext system.” To use it, a visitor would sit at a terminal and begin reading the displayed text. For the passage “The exhibition you are attending is called &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It was organized by Jack Burnham,” you could use keystrokes (such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;forward&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) to navigate the text and retrieve a definition of “software” or biographical details about Burnham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;A black and white photo of four people posing in front of a computer terminal that displays a stack of triangles. &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;24096&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-black-and-white-photo-of-four-people-posing-in-front-of-a-computer-terminal-that-displays-a-stack-of-triangles.jpg?id=62293611&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Conceptual artist Agnes Denes [right] programmed her piece &lt;i&gt;Trigonal Ballet&lt;/i&gt; at the Jewish Museum with help from RESISTORS [from left] Peter Eichenberger, J Laurence Sarno, and John Levine.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;The Jewish Museum&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many museumgoers, the entire exhibition suggested a technological future where people easily navigated the information-rich realm of what would become known as cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RESISTORS, meanwhile, gradually faded throughout the 1970s as its members went off to college and the supply of new recruits dwindled. Nonetheless, members like Nat Kuhn and John Levine recall that ideas they bantered about in bull sessions with Nelson in Kagan’s barn materialized later in the pages of &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computer Lib/Dream Machines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “There was certainly very little in that book that we hadn’t already heard about before it appeared,” Levine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I talked with former RESISTORS, it was surprising to hear how many members remained in touch with one another more than a half-century later. Many of them still included their participation on résumés. Courtships formed, and at least two members married each other.

          <div class="tag" style="margin-top:6px">&lt;img src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/person-next-to-healthcare-device-looking-at-phone.jpg?id=62288369&amp;amp;width=2000&amp;amp;height=1500&amp;amp;coordinates=166%2C0%2C167%2C0&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was interviewing a 72-year-old retired accountant who had unplugged his &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/monitor-diabetes-from-your-smart-watch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;smart glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt;. He explained that he “didn’t know who was looking” at his blood sugar data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t a man unfamiliar with technology—he had successfully used computers for decades in his career. He was of sound mind. But when it came to his health device, he couldn’t find clear answers about where his data went, who could access it, or how to control it. The instructions were dense, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/protecting-online-privacy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;privacy settings&lt;/a&gt; were buried in multiple menus. So, he made what seemed like the safest choice: he unplugged it. That decision meant giving up real-time glucose monitoring that his doctor had recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The healthcare IoT (Internet of Things) market is &lt;a href=&#34;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iot-healthcare-market-worth-289-140000086.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;projected&lt;/a&gt; to exceed $289 billion by 2028, with older adults representing a major share of users. These devices are fall detectors, medication reminders, glucose monitors, heart rate trackers, and others that enable independent living. Yet there’s a widening gap between deployment and adoption. According to an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aarp.org/personal-technology/companies-address-online-privacy-concerns/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AARP survey&lt;/a&gt;, 34% of adults over 50 list privacy as a primary barrier to adopting health technology. That represents millions of people who could benefit from monitoring tools but avoid them because they don’t feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my study at the University of Denver’s Ritchie School of Engineering and Computer Science, I surveyed 22 older adults and conducted in-depth interviews with nine participants who use health-monitoring devices. The findings revealed a critical engineering failure: 82% understood security concepts like &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/two-factor-authentication-sandia-labs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/homomorphic-encryption&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;encryption&lt;/a&gt;, yet only 14% felt confident managing their privacy when using these devices. In my research, I also evaluated 28 healthcare apps designed for older adults and found that 79% lacked basic breach-notification protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One participant told me, “I know there’s encryption, but I don’t know if it’s really enough to protect my data.” Another said, “The thought of my health data getting into the wrong hands is very concerning. I’m particularly worried about identity theft or my information being used for scams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a user knowledge problem; it’s an engineering problem. We’ve built systems that demand technical expertise to operate safely, then handed them to people managing complex health needs while navigating age-related changes in vision, cognition, and dexterity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measuring the Gap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify the issues with privacy setting transparency, I developed the Privacy Risk Assessment Framework (PRAF), a tool that scores healthcare apps across five critical domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the regulatory compliance domain evaluates whether apps explicitly state adherence to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or other data protection standards. Just claiming to be compliant is not enough—they must provide verifiable evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the security mechanisms&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;domain assesses the implementation of encryption, access controls, and, most critically, breach-notification protocols that alert users when their data may have been compromised. Third, in the usability and accessibility domain, the tool examines whether privacy interfaces are readable and navigable for people with age-related visual or cognitive changes. Fourth, data-minimization practices evaluate whether apps collect only necessary information and clearly specify retention periods. Finally, third-party sharing transparency measures whether users can easily understand who has access to their data and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I applied PRAF to 28 healthcare apps commonly used by older adults, the results revealed systemic gaps. Only 25% explicitly stated HIPAA compliance, and just 18% mentioned GDPR compliance. Most alarmingly, 79% lacked breach notification protocols, which means that the users may never find out if their data was compromised. The average privacy policy readability scored at a 12th-grade level, even though &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16541986/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; that the average reading level of older adults is at an 8th grade level&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Not a single app included accessibility accommodations in their privacy interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider what happens when an older adult opens a typical health app. They face a multi-page privacy policy full of legal terminology about “data controllers” and “processing purposes,” followed by settings scattered across multiple menus. One participant told me, “The instructions are hard to understand, the print is too small, and it’s overwhelming.” Another explained, “I don’t feel adequately informed about how my data is collected, stored, and shared. It seems like most of these companies are after profit, and they don’t make it easy for users to understand what’s happening with their data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When protection requires a manual people can’t read, two outcomes follow: they either skip security altogether leaving themselves vulnerable, or abandon the technology entirely, forfeiting its health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Engineering for privacy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to treat trust as an engineering specification, not a marketing promise. Based on my research findings and the specific barriers older adults face, three approaches address the root causes of distrust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first approach is adaptive security defaults. Rather than requiring users to navigate complex configuration menus, devices should ship with pre-configured best practices that automatically adjust to data sensitivity and device type. A fall detection system doesn’t need the same settings as a continuous glucose monitor. This approach draws from the principle of “security by default” in systems engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biometric or voice authentication can replace passwords that are easily forgotten or written down. The key is removing the burden of expertise while maintaining strong protection. As one participant put it: “Simplified security settings, better educational resources, and more intuitive user interfaces will be beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second approach is real-time transparency&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Users shouldn’t have to dig through settings to see where their data goes. Instead, notification systems should show each data access or sharing event in plain language. For example: “Your doctor accessed your heart-rate data at 2 p.m. to review for your upcoming appointment.” A single dashboard should summarize who has access and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This addresses a concern that came up repeatedly in my interviews: users want to know who is seeing their data and why. The engineering challenge here isn’t technical complexity, it’s designing interfaces that convey technical realities in language anyone can understand. Such systems already exist in other domains; banking apps, for instance, send immediate notifications for every transaction. The same principle applies to health data, where the stakes are arguably higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third approach is invisible security updates. Manual patching creates vulnerability windows. Automatic, seamless updates should be standard for any device handling health data, paired with a simple status indicator so users can confirm protection at a glance. As one participant said, “The biggest issue that we as seniors have is the fact that we don’t remember our passwords... The new technology is surpassing the ability of seniors to keep up with it.” Automating updates removes a significant source of anxiety and risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s at Stake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can keep building healthcare IoT the way we have: fast, feature-rich, and fundamentally untrustworthy. Or, we can engineer systems that are transparent, secure, and usable by design. Trust isn’t something you market through slogans or legal disclaimers. It’s something you engineer, line by line, into the code itself.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;For older adults relying on technology to maintain independence, that kind of engineering matters more than any new feature we could add. Every unplugged glucose monitor, every abandoned fall detector, every health app deleted out of confusion or fear represents not just a lost sale but a missed opportunity to support someone’s health and autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge of privacy in healthcare IoT goes beyond fixing existing systems, it requires reimagining how we communicate privacy itself. My ongoing research builds on these findings through an AI-driven Data Helper, a system that uses large language models to translate dense legal privacy policies into short, accurate, and accessible summaries for older adults. By making data practices transparent and comprehension measurable, this approach aims to turn compliance into understanding and trust, thus advancing the next generation of trustworthy digital health systems.&lt;/p&gt;</div>

He pioneered the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) to train deep learning models in the late 2000s with his students at &lt;a href=&#34;https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, cofounded &lt;a href=&#34;https://research.google/teams/brain/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Brain&lt;/a&gt; in 2011, and then served for three years as chief scientist for &lt;a href=&#34;https://ir.baidu.com/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt;, where he helped build the Chinese tech giant’s AI group. So when he says he has identified the next big shift in artificial intelligence, people listen. And that’s what he told &lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt; in an exclusive Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Ng’s current efforts are focused on his company 
	&lt;a href=&#34;https://landing.ai/about/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Landing AI&lt;/a&gt;, which built a platform called LandingLens to help manufacturers improve visual inspection with computer vision. He has also become something of an evangelist for what he calls the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;data-centric AI movement&lt;/a&gt;, which he says can yield “small data” solutions to big issues in AI, including model efficiency, accuracy, and bias.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Andrew Ng on...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#big&#34;&gt;What’s next for really big models&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#career&#34;&gt;The career advice he didn’t listen to&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#defining&#34;&gt;Defining the data-centric AI movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#synthetic&#34;&gt;Synthetic data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#work&#34;&gt;Why Landing AI asks its customers to do the work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The great advances in deep learning over the past decade or so have been powered by ever-bigger models crunching ever-bigger amounts of data. Some people argue that that’s an &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-learning-computational-cost&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;unsustainable trajectory&lt;/a&gt;. Do you agree that it can’t go on that way?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Ng: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a big question. We’ve seen foundation models in NLP [natural language processing]. I’m excited about NLP models getting even bigger, and also about the potential of building foundation models in computer vision. I think there’s lots of signal to still be exploited in video: We have not been able to build foundation models yet for video because of compute bandwidth and the cost of processing video, as opposed to tokenized text. So I think that this engine of scaling up deep learning algorithms, which has been running for something like 15 years now, still has steam in it. Having said that, it only applies to certain problems, and there’s a set of other problems that need small data solutions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When you say you want a foundation model for computer vision, what do you mean by that?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a term coined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Percy Liang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://crfm.stanford.edu/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some of my friends at Stanford&lt;/a&gt; to refer to very large models, trained on very large data sets, that can be tuned for specific applications. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-ais-powerful-text-generating-tool-is-ready-for-business&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;GPT-3&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a foundation model [for NLP]. Foundation models offer a lot of promise as a new paradigm in developing machine learning applications, but also challenges in terms of making sure that they’re reasonably fair and free from bias, especially if many of us will be building on top of them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What needs to happen for someone to build a foundation model for video?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng:&lt;/strong&gt; I think there is a scalability problem. The compute power needed to process the large volume of images for video is significant, and I think that’s why foundation models have arisen first in NLP. Many researchers are working on this, and I think we’re seeing early signs of such models being developed in computer vision. But I’m confident that if a semiconductor maker gave us 10 times more processor power, we could easily find 10 times more video to build such models for vision.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Having said that, a lot of what’s happened over the past decade is that deep learning has happened in consumer-facing companies that have large user bases, sometimes billions of users, and therefore very large data sets. While that paradigm of machine learning has driven a lot of economic value in consumer software, I find that that recipe of scale doesn’t work for other industries.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#top&#34;&gt;Back to top&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;It’s funny to hear you say that, because your early work was at a consumer-facing company with millions of users.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng: &lt;/strong&gt;Over a decade ago, when I proposed starting the &lt;a href=&#34;https://research.google/teams/brain/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Brain&lt;/a&gt; project to use Google’s compute infrastructure to build very large neural networks, it was a controversial step. One very senior person pulled me aside and warned me that starting Google Brain would be bad for my career. I think he felt that the action couldn’t just be in scaling up, and that I should instead focus on architecture innovation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;pull-quote&#34;&gt;
	“In many industries where giant data sets simply don’t exist, I think the focus has to shift from big data to good data. Having 50 thoughtfully engineered examples can be sufficient to explain to the neural network what you want it to learn.”&lt;br /&gt;
	—Andrew Ng, CEO &amp; Founder, Landing AI
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I remember when my students and I published the first 
	&lt;a href=&#34;https://nips.cc/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NeurIPS&lt;/a&gt; workshop paper advocating using &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CUDA&lt;/a&gt;, a platform for processing on GPUs, for deep learning—a different senior person in AI sat me down and said, “CUDA is really complicated to program. As a programming paradigm, this seems like too much work.” I did manage to convince him; the other person I did not convince.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I expect they’re both convinced now.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng:&lt;/strong&gt; I think so, yes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Over the past year as I’ve been speaking to people about the data-centric AI movement, I’ve been getting flashbacks to when I was speaking to people about deep learning and scalability 10 or 15 years ago. In the past year, I’ve been getting the same mix of “there’s nothing new here” and “this seems like the wrong direction.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#top&#34;&gt;Back to top&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;How do you define data-centric AI, and why do you consider it a movement?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng:&lt;/strong&gt; Data-centric AI is the discipline of systematically engineering the data needed to successfully build an AI system. For an AI system, you have to implement some algorithm, say a neural network, in code and then train it on your data set. The dominant paradigm over the last decade was to download the data set while you focus on improving the code. Thanks to that paradigm, over the last decade deep learning networks have improved significantly, to the point where for a lot of applications the code—the neural network architecture—is basically a solved problem. So for many practical applications, it’s now more productive to hold the neural network architecture fixed, and instead find ways to improve the data.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	When I started speaking about this, there were many practitioners who, completely appropriately, raised their hands and said, “Yes, we’ve been doing this for 20 years.” This is the time to take the things that some individuals have been doing intuitively and make it a systematic engineering discipline.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The data-centric AI movement is much bigger than one company or group of researchers. My collaborators and I organized a 
	&lt;a href=&#34;https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/workshop/21860&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;data-centric AI workshop at NeurIPS&lt;/a&gt;, and I was really delighted at the number of authors and presenters that showed up.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You often talk about companies or institutions that have only a small amount of data to work with. How can data-centric AI help them?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng: &lt;/strong&gt;You hear a lot about vision systems built with millions of images—I once built a face recognition system using 350 million images. Architectures built for hundreds of millions of images don’t work with only 50 images. But it turns out, if you have 50 really good examples, you can build something valuable, like a defect-inspection system. In many industries where giant data sets simply don’t exist, I think the focus has to shift from big data to good data. Having 50 thoughtfully engineered examples can be sufficient to explain to the neural network what you want it to learn.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When you talk about training a model with just 50 images, does that really mean you’re taking an existing model that was trained on a very large data set and fine-tuning it? Or do you mean a brand new model that’s designed to learn only from that small data set?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng: &lt;/strong&gt;Let me describe what Landing AI does. When doing visual inspection for manufacturers, we often use our own flavor of &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/how-retinanet-works/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RetinaNet&lt;/a&gt;. It is a pretrained model. Having said that, the pretraining is a small piece of the puzzle. What’s a bigger piece of the puzzle is providing tools that enable the manufacturer to pick the right set of images [to use for fine-tuning] and label them in a consistent way. There’s a very practical problem we’ve seen spanning vision, NLP, and speech, where even human annotators don’t agree on the appropriate label. For big data applications, the common response has been: If the data is noisy, let’s just get a lot of data and the algorithm will average over it. But if you can develop tools that flag where the data’s inconsistent and give you a very targeted way to improve the consistency of the data, that turns out to be a more efficient way to get a high-performing system.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;pull-quote&#34;&gt;
	“Collecting more data often helps, but if you try to collect more data for everything, that can be a very expensive activity.”&lt;br /&gt;
	—Andrew Ng
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	For example, if you have 10,000 images where 30 images are of one class, and those 30 images are labeled inconsistently, one of the things we do is build tools to draw your attention to the subset of data that’s inconsistent. So you can very quickly relabel those images to be more consistent, and this leads to improvement in performance.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Could this focus on high-quality data help with bias in data sets? If you’re able to curate the data more before training?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng:&lt;/strong&gt; Very much so. Many researchers have pointed out that biased data is one factor among many leading to biased systems. There have been many thoughtful efforts to engineer the data. At the NeurIPS workshop, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Olga Russakovsky&lt;/a&gt; gave a really nice talk on this. At the main NeurIPS conference, I also really enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/invited-talk/22281&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mary Gray’s presentation,&lt;/a&gt; which touched on how data-centric AI is one piece of the solution, but not the entire solution. New tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/datasheets-for-datasets/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Datasheets for Datasets&lt;/a&gt; also seem like an important piece of the puzzle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	One of the powerful tools that data-centric AI gives us is the ability to engineer a subset of the data. Imagine training a machine-learning system and finding that its performance is okay for most of the data set, but its performance is biased for just a subset of the data. If you try to change the whole neural network architecture to improve the performance on just that subset, it’s quite difficult. But if you can engineer a subset of the data you can address the problem in a much more targeted way.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When you talk about engineering the data, what do you mean exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng: &lt;/strong&gt;In AI, data cleaning is important, but the way the data has been cleaned has often been in very manual ways. In computer vision, someone may visualize images through a &lt;a href=&#34;https://jupyter.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jupyter notebook&lt;/a&gt; and maybe spot the problem, and maybe fix it. But I’m excited about tools that allow you to have a very large data set, tools that draw your attention quickly and efficiently to the subset of data where, say, the labels are noisy. Or to quickly bring your attention to the one class among 100 classes where it would benefit you to collect more data. Collecting more data often helps, but if you try to collect more data for everything, that can be a very expensive activity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	For example, I once figured out that a speech-recognition system was performing poorly when there was car noise in the background. Knowing that allowed me to collect more data with car noise in the background, rather than trying to collect more data for everything, which would have been expensive and slow.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#top&#34;&gt;Back to top&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What about using synthetic data, is that often a good solution?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng: &lt;/strong&gt;I think synthetic data is an important tool in the tool chest of data-centric AI. At the NeurIPS workshop, &lt;a href=&#34;https://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Anima Anandkumar&lt;/a&gt; gave a great talk that touched on synthetic data. I think there are important uses of synthetic data that go beyond just being a preprocessing step for increasing the data set for a learning algorithm. I’d love to see more tools to let developers use synthetic data generation as part of the closed loop of iterative machine learning development.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Do you mean that synthetic data would allow you to try the model on more data sets?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng: &lt;/strong&gt;Not really. Here’s an example. Let’s say you’re trying to detect defects in a smartphone casing. There are many different types of defects on smartphones. It could be a scratch, a dent, pit marks, discoloration of the material, other types of blemishes. If you train the model and then find through error analysis that it’s doing well overall but it’s performing poorly on pit marks, then synthetic data generation allows you to address the problem in a more targeted way. You could generate more data just for the pit-mark category.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;pull-quote&#34;&gt;
	“In the consumer software Internet, we could train a handful of machine-learning models to serve a billion users. In manufacturing, you might have 10,000 manufacturers building 10,000 custom AI models.”&lt;br /&gt;
	—Andrew Ng
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Synthetic data generation is a very powerful tool, but there are many simpler tools that I will often try first. Such as data augmentation, improving labeling consistency, or just asking a factory to collect more data.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#top&#34;&gt;Back to top&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To make these issues more concrete, can you walk me through an example? When a company approaches &lt;a href=&#34;https://landing.ai/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Landing AI&lt;/a&gt; and says it has a problem with visual inspection, how do you onboard them and work toward deployment?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng: &lt;/strong&gt;When a customer approaches us we usually have a conversation about their inspection problem and look at a few images to verify that the problem is feasible with computer vision. Assuming it is, we ask them to upload the data to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://landing.ai/platform/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LandingLens&lt;/a&gt; platform. We often advise them on the methodology of data-centric AI and help them label the data.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	One of the foci of Landing AI is to empower manufacturing companies to do the machine learning work themselves. A lot of our work is making sure the software is fast and easy to use. Through the iterative process of machine learning development, we advise customers on things like how to train models on the platform, when and how to improve the labeling of data so the performance of the model improves. Our training and software supports them all the way through deploying the trained model to an edge device in the factory.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;How do you deal with changing needs? If products change or lighting conditions change in the factory, can the model keep up?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng:&lt;/strong&gt; It varies by manufacturer. There is data drift in many contexts. But there are some manufacturers that have been running the same manufacturing line for 20 years now with few changes, so they don’t expect changes in the next five years. Those stable environments make things easier. For other manufacturers, we provide tools to flag when there’s a significant data-drift issue. I find it really important to empower manufacturing customers to correct data, retrain, and update the model. Because if something changes and it’s 3 a.m. in the United States, I want them to be able to adapt their learning algorithm right away to maintain operations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In the consumer software Internet, we could train a handful of machine-learning models to serve a billion users. In manufacturing, you might have 10,000 manufacturers building 10,000 custom AI models. The challenge is, how do you do that without Landing AI having to hire 10,000 machine learning specialists?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;So you’re saying that to make it scale, you have to empower customers to do a lot of the training and other work.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, exactly! This is an industry-wide problem in AI, not just in manufacturing. Look at health care. Every hospital has its own slightly different format for electronic health records. How can every hospital train its own custom AI model? Expecting every hospital’s IT personnel to invent new neural-network architectures is unrealistic. The only way out of this dilemma is to build tools that empower the customers to build their own models by giving them tools to engineer the data and express their domain knowledge. That’s what Landing AI is executing in computer vision, and the field of AI needs other teams to execute this in other domains.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else you think it’s important for people to understand about the work you’re doing or the data-centric AI movement?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ng: &lt;/strong&gt;In the last decade, the biggest shift in AI was a shift to deep learning. I think it’s quite possible that in this decade the biggest shift will be to data-centric AI. With the maturity of today’s neural network architectures, I think for a lot of the practical applications the bottleneck will be whether we can efficiently get the data we need to develop systems that work well. The data-centric AI movement has tremendous energy and momentum across the whole community. I hope more researchers and developers will jump in and work on it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans excel at processing vast arrays of visual information, a skill that is crucial for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Over the decades, AI researchers have developed Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems to interpret scenes within single images and answer related questions. While recent advancements in foundation models have significantly closed the gap between human and machine visual processing, conventional VQA has been restricted to reason about only &lt;strong&gt;single&lt;/strong&gt; images at a time rather than whole collections of visual data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This limitation poses challenges in more complex scenarios. Take, for example, the challenges of discerning patterns in collections of medical images, monitoring deforestation through satellite imagery, mapping urban changes using autonomous navigation data, analyzing thematic elements across large art collections, or understanding consumer behavior from retail surveillance footage. Each of these scenarios entails not only visual processing across hundreds or thousands of images but also necessitates cross-image processing of these findings. To address this gap, this project focuses on the “Multi-Image Question Answering” (MIQA) task, which exceeds the reach of traditional VQA systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Visual Haystacks&lt;/b&gt;: the first &#34;visual-centric&#34; Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in processing long-context visual information.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-benchmark-vqa-models-on-miqa&#34;&gt;How to Benchmark VQA Models on MIQA?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Needle-In-A-Haystack” (NIAH) challenge has recently become one of the most popular paradigms for benchmarking LLM’s ability to process inputs containing “long contexts”, large sets of input data (such as long documents, videos, or hundreds of images). In this task, essential information (“the needle”), which contains the answer to a specific question, is embedded within a vast amount of data (“the haystack”). The system must then retrieve the relevant information and answer the question correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first NIAH benchmark for visual reasoning was introduced by Google in the Gemini-v1.5 &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05530&#34;&gt;technical report&lt;/a&gt;. In this report, they asked their models to retrieve text overlaid on a single frame in a large video. It turns out that existing models perform quite well on this task—primarily due to their strong OCR retrieval capabilities. But what if we ask more visual questions? Do models still perform as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-visual-haystacks-vhs-benchmark&#34;&gt;What is the Visual Haystacks (VHs) Benchmark?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pursuit of evaluating “visual-centric” long-context reasoning capabilities, we introduce the “Visual Haystacks (VHs)” benchmark. This new benchmark is designed to assess Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in visual &lt;strong&gt;retrieval&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;reasoning&lt;/strong&gt; across large uncorrelated image sets. VHs features approximately 1K binary question-answer pairs, with each set containing anywhere from 1 to 10K images. Unlike previous benchmarks that focused on textual retrieval and reasoning, VHs questions center on identifying the presence of specific visual content, such as objects, utilizing images and annotations from the COCO dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VHs benchmark is divided into two main challenges, each designed to test the model’s ability to accurately locate and analyze relevant images before responding to queries. We have carefully designed the dataset to ensure that guessing or relying on common sense reasoning without viewing the image won’t get any advantages (i.e., resulting in a 50% accuracy rate on a binary QA task).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Needle Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;: Only a single needle image exists in the haystack of images. The question is framed as, “For the image with the anchor object, is there a target object?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Needle Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;: Two to five needle images exist in the haystack of images. The question is framed as either, “For all images with the anchor object, do all of them contain the target object?” or “For all images with the anchor object, do any of them contain the target object?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-important-findings-from-vhs&#34;&gt;Three Important Findings from VHs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Visual Haystacks (VHs) benchmark reveals significant challenges faced by current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) when processing extensive visual inputs. In our experiments&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; rel=&#34;footnote&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; across both single and multi-needle modes, we evaluated several open-source and proprietary methods including &lt;a href=&#34;https://llava-vl.github.io/&#34;&gt;LLaVA-v1.5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/&#34;&gt;GPT-4o&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family&#34;&gt;Claude-3 Opus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/#context-window&#34;&gt;Gemini-v1.5-pro&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, we include a “Captioning” baseline, employing a two-stage approach where images are initially captioned using LLaVA, followed by answering the question using the captions’ text content with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/&#34;&gt;Llama3&lt;/a&gt;. Below are three pivotal insights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Struggles with Visual Distractors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In single-needle settings, a notable decline in performance was observed as the number of images increased, despite maintaining high oracle accuracy—a scenario absent in prior text-based Gemini-style benchmarks. This shows that existing models may mainly struggle with visual retrieval, especially in the presence of challenging visual distractors. Furthermore, it’s crucial to highlight the constraints on open-source LMMs like LLaVA, which can handle only up to three images due to a 2K context length limit. On the other hand, proprietary models such as Gemini-v1.5 and GPT-4o, despite their claims of extended context capabilities, often fail to manage requests when the image count exceeds 1K, due to payload size limits when using the API call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/visual-haystacks/single_needle_analyses.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;Performance on VHs for single-needle questions. All models experience significant falloff as the size of the haystack (N) increases, suggesting none of them are robust against visual distractors. E: Exceeds context length.&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty Reasoning Across Multiple Images&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, all LMM-based methods showed weak performance with 5+ images in single-image QA and all multi-needle settings compared to a basic approach chaining a captioning model (LLaVA) with an LLM aggregator (Llama3). This discrepancy suggests that while LLMs are capable of integrating long-context captions effectively, existing LMM-based solutions are inadequate for processing and integrating information across multiple images. Notably, the performance hugely deteriorates in multi-image scenarios, with Claude-3 Opus showing weak results with only oracle images, and Gemini-1.5/GPT-4o dropping to 50% accuracy (just like a random guess) with larger sets of 50 images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/visual-haystacks/multi_needle_analyses.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;Results on VHs for multi-needle questions. All visually-aware models perform poorly, indicating that models find it challenging to implicitly integrate visual information.&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phenomena in Visual Domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we found that the accuracy of LMMs is hugely affected by the position of the needle image within the input sequence. For instance, LLaVA shows better performance when the needle image is placed immediately before the question, suffering up to a 26.5% drop otherwise. In contrast, proprietary models generally perform better when the image is positioned at the start, experiencing up to a 28.5% decrease when not. This pattern echoes the &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172&#34;&gt;“lost-in-the-middle”&lt;/a&gt; phenomenon seen in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), where crucial information positioned at the beginning or end of the context influences model performance. This issue was not evident in previous Gemini-style NIAH evaluation, which only required text retrieval and reasoning, underscoring the unique challenges posed by our VHs benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/visual-haystacks/fig2.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;Needle position vs. performance on VHs for various image settings. Existing LMMs show up to 41% performance drop when the needle is not ideally placed. Gray boxes: Exceeds context length.
&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mirage-a-rag-based-solution-for-improved-vhs-performance&#34;&gt;MIRAGE: A RAG-based Solution for Improved VHs Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the experimental results above, it is clear that the core challenges of existing solutions in MIQA lie in the ability to (1) accurately &lt;strong&gt;retrieve&lt;/strong&gt; relevant images from a vast pool of potentially unrelated images without positional biases and (2) &lt;strong&gt;integrate&lt;/strong&gt; relevant visual information from these images to correctly answer the question. To address these issues, we introduce an open-source and simple single-stage training paradigm, “MIRAGE” (Multi-Image Retrieval Augmented Generation), which extends the &lt;a href=&#34;https://llava-vl.github.io/&#34;&gt;LLaVA&lt;/a&gt; model to handle MIQA tasks. The image below shows our model architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;MIRAGE&#39;s Framework&#34; src=&#34;https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/visual-haystacks/method_data.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our proposed paradigm consists of several components, each designed to alleviate key issues in the MIQA task:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compress existing encodings&lt;/strong&gt;: The MIRAGE paradigm leverages a query-aware compression model to reduce the visual encoder tokens to a smaller subset (10x smaller), allowing for more images in the same context length.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employ retriever to filter out irrelevant message&lt;/strong&gt;: MIRAGE uses a retriever trained in-line with the LLM fine-tuning, to predict if an image will be relevant, and dynamically drop irrelevant images.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Image Training Data&lt;/strong&gt;: MIRAGE augments existing single-image instruction fine-tuning data with multi-image reasoning data, and synthetic multi-image reasoning data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We revisit the VHs benchmark with MIRAGE. In addition to being capable of handling 1K or 10K images, MIRAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance on most single-needle tasks, despite having a weaker single-image QA backbone with only 32 tokens per image!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;VHs_with_MIRAGE&#34; src=&#34;https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/visual-haystacks/single_needle_analyses_mirage.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also benchmark MIRAGE and other LMM-based models on a variety of VQA tasks. On multi-image tasks, MIRAGE demonstrates strong recall and precision capabilities, significantly outperforming strong competitors like GPT-4, Gemini-v1.5, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://largeworldmodel.github.io/&#34;&gt;Large World Model (LWM)&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, it shows competitive single-image QA performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;VQA evaluation results&#34; src=&#34;https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/visual-haystacks/final_vqa_evaluation.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we compare MIRAGE’s co-trained retriever with &lt;a href=&#34;https://openai.com/index/clip/&#34;&gt;CLIP&lt;/a&gt;. Our retriever performs significantly better than CLIP without losing efficiency. This shows that while CLIP models can be good retrievers for open-vocabulary image retrieval, they may not work well when dealing with question-like texts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Ablation Studies&#34; src=&#34;https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/visual-haystacks/ablation_studies.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-remarks&#34;&gt;Final Remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we develop the Visual Haystacks (VHs) benchmark and identified three prevalent deficiencies in existing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Struggles with Visual Distractors&lt;/strong&gt;: In single-needle tasks, LMMs exhibit a sharp performance decline as the number of images increases, indicating a significant challenge in filtering out irrelevant visual information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty Reasoning Across Multiple Images&lt;/strong&gt;: In multi-needle settings, simplistic approaches like captioning followed by language-based QA outperform all existing LMMs, highlighting LMMs’ inadequate ability to process information across multiple images.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phenomena in Visual Domain&lt;/strong&gt;: Both proprietary and open-source models display sensitivity to the position of the needle information within image sequences, exhibiting a “loss-in-the-middle” phenomenon in the visual domain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, we propose MIRAGE, a pioneering visual Retriever-Augmented Generator (visual-RAG) framework. MIRAGE addresses these challenges with an innovative visual token compressor, a co-trained retriever, and augmented multi-image instruction tuning data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After exploring this blog post, we encourage all future LMM projects to benchmark their models using the Visual Haystacks framework to identify and rectify potential deficiencies before deployment. We also urge the community to explore multi-image question answering as a means to advance the frontiers of true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).&lt;/p&gt;

          <div class="tag" style="margin-top:6px">&lt;img src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/robotic-dog-lifting-backpack-with-its-mechanical-arm-in-an-industrial-setting.jpg?id=62304619&amp;amp;width=2000&amp;amp;height=1500&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ghostrobotics.io/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ghost Robotics&lt;/a&gt; is today announcing a major upgrade for their Vision 60 quadruped: an arm. Ghost, a company which originated at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, specializes in exceptionally rugged quadrupeds, and while many of its customers use its robots for public safety and disaster relief, it also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.army.mil/article/274841/promising_experiment_signals_future_integration_of_advanced_tech_into_army_units&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;provides robots&lt;/a&gt; to the United States military, which has very specific needs when it comes to keeping humans out of danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that context, it’s not unreasonable to assume that Ghost’s robots may sometimes be used to carry weapons, and despite the &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-killer-drones&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;proliferation of robots&lt;/a&gt; in many roles in the Ukraine war, the idea of a legged robot carrying a weapon is not a comfortable one for many people. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Ghost co-founder and current CEO &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavin-kenneally-321a3833/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gavin Kenneally&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the new arm, and to get his perspective on selling robots to the military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Green military robot dog opens a wooden door with articulated arm.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;a501b&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/green-military-robot-dog-opens-a-wooden-door-with-articulated-arm.jpg?id=62304622&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;The Vision 60’s new arm  has six degrees of freedom. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;Ghost Robotics&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Robots for the Military&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghost Robotics initially made a name for itself with its very impressive &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-minitaur-quadruped&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;early work with the Minitaur direct-drive quadruped&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. The company also made headlines in late 2021, when a now-deleted post on Twitter (now X) went viral because it included a photograph of one of Ghost’s Vision 60 quadrupeds &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-armed-military-robots&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;with a rifle mounted on its back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That picture resulted in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/news/koditscheks-letter-to-ghosts-ceo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;very strong reaction&lt;/a&gt;, although as &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reported at the time, robots with guns affixed to them wasn’t new: To mention one early example, the U.S. military had already deployed weapons on mobile robots &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/2008/04/armed-robots-st/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in Iraq in 2007&lt;/a&gt;. And while several legged robot companies &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/robots-with-weapons-industry-initiative&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;pledged in 2022 not to weaponize their general purpose robots&lt;/a&gt;, the Chinese military &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/may/30/chinese-armys-latest-weapon-gun-toting-dog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in 2024 displayed&lt;/a&gt; quadrupeds from Unitree equipped with guns. (Unitree, based in China, was one of the signers of the 2022 pledge.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of weaponized robots goes far beyond Ghost Robotics, and far beyond robots with legs. We’ve covered both the &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/we-should-not-ban-killer-robots&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;practical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-path-towards-reasonable-autonomous-weapons-regulation&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;ethical&lt;/a&gt; perspectives on this extensively at &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and the intensity of the debates show that there is no easy answer. But to summarize one important point made by some ethicists, some military experts, and Ghost Robotics itself: robots are replaceable, humans are not. “Customers use our robots to keep people out of harm’s way,” Ghost CEO Kenneally tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spectrum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth pointing out that even the companies who signed the pledge not to weaponize their general purpose robots &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/robots-with-weapons-industry-initiative&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;acknowledge&lt;/a&gt; that military robots exist, and are accepting of that, provided that such robots are used under existing legal doctrines and operate within those safeguards—and that what constraints should or should not be imposed on these kinds of robots is best decided by policymakers rather than industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is essentially Ghost Robotics’ position as well, says Kenneally. “We sell our robots to U.S. and allied governments, and as part of that, the robots are used in defense applications where they will sometimes be weaponized. What’s most critical to us is that the decisions about how to use these robots are happening systematically and ethically at the government policy level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some extent, these decisions are already being made within the U.S. government. &lt;a href=&#34;https://media.defense.gov/2023/Jan/25/2003149928/-1/-1/0/DOD-DIRECTIVE-3000.09-AUTONOMY-IN-WEAPON-SYSTEMS.PDF&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Department of Defense Directive 3000.09&lt;/a&gt;, ‘Autonomy in Weapon Systems,’ lays out the responsibilities and limitations for how autonomous or human-directed robotics weapons systems should be developed and deployed, including requirements for human use-of-force judgements. At least in the U.S., this directive implies that there are rules and accountability for robotic weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vision 60’s Versatile Arm Capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghost sees its Vision 60 quadruped as a system that its trusted customers can use as they see fit, and the manipulator enables many additional capabilities. “The primary purpose of the robot has been as a sensor platform,” Kenneally says, “but sometimes there are doors in the way, or objects that need to be moved, or you might want the robot to take a sample. So the ability to do all of that mobile manipulation has been hugely valuable for our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, arms are good for more than manipulation. “One thing that’s been very interesting is that our customers have been using the arm as a sensor boom, which is something that we hadn’t anticipated,” says Kenneally. Ghost’s robot has plenty of cameras, but they’re mostly at the viewpoint of a moderately-sized dog. The new arm offers a more human-like vantage and a way to peek around corners or over things without exposing the whole robot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghost was not particularly interested in building their own arm, and tried off-the-shelf options to get the manipulation bit working. And they did get the manipulation working; what didn’t work were any of those arms after the 50 kilogram robot rolled over on them. “We wanted to make sure that we could build an arm that could stand up to the same intense rigors of our customers’ operations that the rest of the robot can,” says Kenneally. “Morphologically, we actually consider the arm to be a fifth leg, so that the robot operates as a unified system for whole-body control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the robot is exceptionally rugged, which is what makes it appealing to customers with unique needs, like special forces teams. Enough battery life for more than three hours of walking (or more than 20 hours on standby) isn’t bad, and the Vision 60 is sealed against sand and dust, and can survive complete submergence in shallow water. It can operate in extreme temperatures ranging from -40 °C to 55 °C, which has been a particular challenge for robots. And if you do manage to put it in a situation where it physically breaks one of its legs, it’s easy to swap in a spare in just a few minutes, even out in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Robotic dog opening a glass door with its arm in front of a building.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;724f7&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/robotic-dog-opening-a-glass-door-with-its-arm-in-front-of-a-building.jpg?id=62304623&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;The Vision 60 can open doors withe high-level direction from a human operator.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;Ghost Robotics&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quadruped Robot Competition From China&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Ghost quietly selling over a thousand quadrupeds to date, Kenneally is cautious about the near future for legged robots, as is anyone who has seriously considered buying one, because it’s impossible to ignore the option of just buying one from a Chinese company at about a tenth the cost of a quadruped from a company based in the U.S. or Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“China has identified legged robotics as a lynchpin technology that they are strategically funding,” Kenneally says. “I think it’s an extremely serious threat in the long term, and we have to take these competitors very seriously despite their current shortcomings.” There is a technological moat, for now, but if the market for legged robots follows the same trajectory as the market for drones did, that moat will shrink drastically over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States is poised to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reuters.com/world/us/chinese-dronemaker-dji-urges-us-complete-security-review-2025-12-04/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ban consumer drone sales from Chinese manufacturer DJI&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2017/08/us-army-just-ordered-soldiers-stop-using-drones-chinas-dji/139999/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;banned DJI drone use by federal agencies in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. But it may be too late in some sense, as DJI’s global market share is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/26/1094249/china-commercial-drone-dji-security/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;something like 90 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Unitree may have already cornered &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/quadruped-state-of-the-market-unitree&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;somewhere around 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the global market for quadrupeds, despite &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/unitree-robot-exploit&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;the recent publication of exploits&lt;/a&gt; that allow the robots to send unauthorized data to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States in particular, private sector robotics funding is unpredictable at the best of times, and Kenneally argues that to compete with Chinese-subsidized robot-makers American companies like Ghost who produce these robots domestically will need sustained U.S. government support, too. That doesn’t mean the government has to pick which companies will be the winners, but that it should find a way to support the U.S. robotics industry as a whole, if it still wants to have a meaningful one. “The quadruped industry isn’t a science project anymore,” says Kenneally. “It’s matured, and quadruped robots are going to become extremely important in both commercial and government applications. But it’s only through continued innovation that we’ll be able to stay ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;</div>

          <div class="tag" style="margin-top:6px">&lt;img src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-rows-of-machines-outdoors-surrounded-by-a-fence.jpg?id=62286808&amp;amp;width=2000&amp;amp;height=1500&amp;amp;coordinates=416%2C0%2C417%2C0&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The power surging through&lt;/strong&gt; transmission lines over the iconic stone walls of England’s northern countryside is pushing the United Kingdom’s grid to its limits. To the north, Scottish wind farms have doubled their output over the past decade. In the south, where electricity demand is heaviest, electrification and new data centers promise to draw more power, but new generation is falling short. Construction on a new 3,280-megawatt nuclear power plant west of London lags years behind schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a lopsided flow of power that’s maxing out transmission corridors from the Highlands to London. That grid strain won’t ease any time soon. New lines linking Scotland to southern England are at least three to four years from operation, and at risk of further delays from fierce local opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is bent on installing even more wind power and slashing fossil-fuel generation by 2030. His Labour government says low-carbon power is cheaper and more secure than natural gas, much of which comes from Norway via the world’s longest underwater gas pipeline and is vulnerable to disruption and sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Map of transmission lines in southern Scotland and northern England.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;1e710&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/map-of-transmission-lines-in-southern-scotland-and-northern-england.png?id=62286818&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;The lack of transmission lines available to move power flowing south from Scottish wind farms has caused grid congestion in England. To better manage it, the U.K. has installed SmartValves at three substations in northern England—Penwortham, Harker, and Saltholme—and is constructing a fourth at South Shields. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;Chris Philpot &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The U.K.’s resulting grid congestion prevents transmission operators from delivering some of their cleanest, cheapest generation to all of the consumers who want it. Congestion is a perennial problem whenever power consumption is on the rise. It pushes circuits to their thermal limits and creates grid stability or security constraints.&lt;p&gt;With congestion relief needed now, the U.K.’s grid operators are getting creative, rapidly tapping new cable designs and innovations in power electronics to squeeze more power through existing transmission corridors. These &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/grid-enhancing-technologies&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;grid-enhancing technologies&lt;/a&gt;, or GETs, present a low-cost way to bridge the gap until new lines can be built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GETs allow us to operate the system harder before an investment arrives, and they save a s***load of money,” says &lt;a href=&#34;https://linkedin.com/in/julian-leslie-b9059535?originalSubdomain=uk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Julian Leslie&lt;/a&gt;, chief engineer and director of strategic energy planning at the National Energy System Operator (NESO), the Warwick-based agency that directs U.K. energy markets and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;A stone wall along a dirt trail with large powerlines running overhead on a sunny day &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;3c272&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-stone-wall-along-a-dirt-trail-with-large-powerlines-running-overhead-on-a-sunny-day.jpg?id=62286810&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Transmission lines running across England’s countryside are maxed out, creating bottlenecks in the grid that prevent some carbon-free power from reaching customers. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;Vincent Lowe/Alamy &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.K.’s extreme grid challenge has made it ground zero for some of the boldest GETs testing and deployment. Such innovation involves some risk, because an intervention anywhere on the U.K.’s tightly meshed power system can have system-wide impacts. (Grid operators elsewhere are choosing to start with GETs at their systems’ periphery—where there’s less impact if something goes wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is how far—and how fast—the U.K.’s grid operators can push GETs capabilities. The new technologies still have a limited track record, so operators are cautiously feeling their way toward heavier investment. Power system experts also have unanswered questions about these advanced grid capabilities. For example, will they create more complexity than grid operators can manage in real time? Might feedback between different devices destabilize the grid?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no consensus yet as to how to even screen for such risks, let alone protect against them, says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.robinpreece.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Robin Preece&lt;/a&gt;, professor in future power systems at the University of Manchester, in England. “We’re at the start of establishing that now, but we’re building at the same time. So it’s kind of this race between the necessity to get this technology installed as quickly as possible, and our ability to fully understand what’s happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is the U.K. Managing Grid Congestion?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most innovative and high-stakes tricks in the U.K.’s toolbox employs electronic power-flow controllers, devices that shift electricity from jammed circuits to those with spare capacity. These devices have been able to finesse enough additional wind power through grid bottlenecks to replace an entire gas-fired generator. Installed in northern England four years ago by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.smartwires.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Smart Wires&lt;/a&gt;, based in Durham, N.C., these SmartValves are expected to help even more as NESO installs more of them and masters their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warwick-based &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nationalgrid.com/electricity-transmission&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;National Grid Electricity Transmission&lt;/a&gt;, the grid operator for England and Wales, is adding SmartValves and also replacing several thousand kilometers of overhead wire with advanced conductors that can carry more current. And it’s using a technique called &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/dynamic-line-rating-grid-congestion&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;dynamic line rating&lt;/a&gt;, whereby sensors and models work together to predict when weather conditions will allow lines to carry extra current.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other kinds of GETs are also being used globally. Advanced conductors are the most widely deployed. Dynamic line rating is increasingly common in European countries, and U.S. utilities are beginning to take it seriously. Europe also leads the world in topology-optimization software, which reconfigures power routes to alleviate congestion, and advanced power-flow-control devices like SmartValves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Workers wearing hard hats and safety harnesses standing high up on an electricity pylon in the countryside&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;4a9a9&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-wearing-hard-hats-and-safety-harnesses-standing-high-up-on-an-electricity-pylon-in-the-countryside.jpg?id=62286977&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Engineers install dynamic line rating technology from the Boston-based company LineVision on National Grid’s transmission network. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;National Grid Electricity Transmission &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartValves’ chops stand out at the Penwortham substation in Lancashire, England, one of two National Grid sites where the device made its U.K. debut in 2021. Penwortham substation is a major transmission hub, whose spokes desperately need congestion relief. Auditory evidence of heavy power flows was clear during my visit to the substation, which buzzes loudly. The sound is due to the electromechanical stresses on the substation’s massive transformers, explains my guide, National Grid commissioned engineer Paul Lloyd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penwortham’s transformers, circuits, and protective relays are spread over 15 hectares, sandwiched between pastureland and suburban homes near Preston, a small city north of Manchester. Power arrives from the north on two pairs of 400-kilovolt AC lines, and most of it exits southward via 400-kV and 275-kV double-circuit wires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Power lines crossing a rural pasture, with an old fence in the foreground and a substation in the background.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;ce7e1&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/power-lines-crossing-a-rural-pasture-with-an-old-fence-in-the-foreground-and-a-substation-in-the-background.jpg?id=62286959&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Transmission lines lead to the congested Penwortham substation, which has become a test-bed for GETs such as  SmartValves and dynamic line rating. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;Peter Fairley &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the substation a strategic test-bed for GETs is its position just north of the U.K. grid’s biggest bottleneck, known as Boundary B7a, which runs east to west across the island. Nine circuits traverse the B7a: the four AC lines headed south from Penwortham, four AC lines closer to Yorkshire’s North Sea coast, and a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) link offshore. In theory, those circuits can collectively carry 13.6 gigawatts across the B7a. But NESO caps its flow at several gigawatts lower to ensure that no circuits overload if any two lines turn off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such limits are necessary for grid reliability, but they are leaving terawatt-hours of wind power stranded in Scotland and increasing consumers’ energy costs: an extra £196 million (US $265 million) in 2024 alone. The costs stem from NESO having to ramp up gas-fired generators to meet demand down south while simultaneously compensating wind-farm operators for curtailing their output, as required under U.K. policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So National Grid keeps tweaking Penwortham. In 2011 the substation got its first big GET: phase-shifting transformers (PSTs), a type of analog flow controller. PSTs adjust power flow by creating an AC waveform whose alternating voltage leads or lags its alternating current. They do so by each PST using a pair of connected transformers to selectively combine power from an AC transmission circuit’s three phases. Motors reposition electrical connections on the transformer coils to adjust flows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Large machines outdoors connected to power lines &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;d09c1&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/large-machines-outdoors-connected-to-power-lines.jpg?id=62286963&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Phase-shifting transformers (PSTs) were installed in 2012 at the Penwortham substation and are the analog predecessor to SmartValves. They’re powerful but also bulky and relatively inflexible. It can take 10 minutes or more for the PST’s motorized actuators at Penwortham to tap their full range of flow control, whereas SmartValves can shift within milliseconds.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;National Grid Electricity Transmission &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Penwortham’s pair of 540-tonne PSTs occupy the entire south end of the substation, along with their dedicated chillers, relays, and power supplies. Delivering all that hardware required extensive road closures and floating a huge barge up the adjacent River Ribble, an event that made national news.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SmartValves at Penwortham stand in stark contrast to the PSTs’ heft, complexity, and mechanics. SmartValves are a type of static synchronous series compensator, or SSSC—a solid-state alternative to PSTs that employs power electronics to tweak power flows in milliseconds. I saw two sets of them tucked into a corner of the substation, occupying a quarter of the area of the PSTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Workers on an elevated platform and tall, cylindrical machinery&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;146f3&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-on-an-elevated-platform-and-tall-cylindrical-machinery.jpg?id=62286971&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;The SmartValve V103 design [above] experienced some teething and reliability issues that were ironed out with the technology’s next iteration, the V104.&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;            National Grid Electricity Transmission/Smart Wires        &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SmartValves are first and foremost an insurance policy to guard against a potentially crippling event: the sudden loss of one of the B7a’s 400-kV lines. If that were to happen, gigawatts of power would instantly seek another route over neighboring lines. And if it happened on a windy day, when lots of power is streaming in from the north, the resulting surge could overload the 275-kV circuits headed from Penwortham to Liverpool. The SmartValves’ job is to save the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They do this by adding impedance to the 275-kV lines, thus acting to divert more power to the remaining 400-kV lines. This rerouting of power prevents a blackout that could potentially cascade through the grid. The upside to that protection is that NESO can safely schedule an additional 350 MW over the B7a.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The savings add up. “That’s 350 MW of wind you’re no longer curtailing from wind farms. So that’s 350 times £100 a megawatt-hour,” says Leslie, at NESO. “That’s also 350 MW of gas-fired power that you don’t need to replace the wind. So that’s 350 times £120 a megawatt-hour. The numbers get big quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266637500&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mark Osborne&lt;/a&gt;, the National Grid lead asset life-cycle engineer managing its SmartValve projects, estimates the devices are saving U.K. customers over £100 million (US $132 million) a year. At that rate, they’ll pay for themselves “within a few years,” Osborne says. By utility standards, where investments are normally amortized over decades, that’s “almost immediately,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Do Grid-Enhancing Technologies Work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way Smart Wires’ SSSC devices adjust power flow is based on emulating impedance, which is a strange beast created by AC power. An AC flow’s changing magnetic field induces an additional voltage in the line’s conductor, which then acts as a drag on the initial field. Smart Wires’ SSSC devices alter power flow by emulating that natural process, effectively adding or subtracting impedance by adding their own voltage wave to the line. Adding a wave that leads the original voltage wave will boost flow, while adding a lagging wave will reduce flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SSSC’s submodules of capacitors and high-speed insulated-gate bipolar transistors operate in sequence to absorb power from a line and synthesize its novel impedance-altering waves. And thanks to its digital controls and switches, the device can within milliseconds flip from maximum power push to maximum pull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can trace the development of SSSCs to the advent of HVDC transmission in the 1950s. HVDC converters take power from an AC grid and efficiently convert it and transfer it over a DC line to another point in the same grid, or to a neighboring AC grid. In 1985, Narain Hingorani, an HVDC expert at the Palo Alto–based Electric Power Research Institute, showed that similar converters could modulate the flow of an AC line. Four years later, Westinghouse engineer Laszlo Gyugyi proposed SSSCs, which became the basis for Smart Wires’ boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major power-equipment manufacturers tried to commercialize SSSCs in the early 2000s. But utilities had little need for flow control back then because they had plenty of conventional power plants that could meet local demand when transmission lines were full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The picture changed as solar and wind generation exploded and conventional plants began shutting down. In years past, grid operators addressed grid congestion by turning power plants on or off in strategic locations. But as of 2024, the U.K. had shut down all of its coal-fired power plants—save one, which now burns wood—and it has vowed to slash gas-fired generation from about a quarter of electricity supply in 2024 to at most 5 percent in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;pull-quote&#34;&gt;The U.K.’s extreme grid challenge has made it ground zero for some of the boldest GETs testing and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To seize the emerging market opportunity presented by changing grid operations, Smart Wires had to make a crucial technology upgrade: ditching transformers. The company’s first SSSC, and those from other suppliers, relied on a transformer to absorb lightning, voltage surges, and every other grid assault that could fry their power electronics. This made them bulky and added cost. So Smart Wires engineers set to work in 2017 to see if they could live without the transformer, says Frank Kreikebaum, Smart Wires’s interim chief of engineering. Two years later the company had assembled a transformerless electronic shield. It consisted of a suite of filters and diverters, along with a control system to activate them. Ditching the transformer produced a trim, standardized product—a modular system-in-a-box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartValves work at any voltage and are generally ganged together to achieve a desired level of flow control. They can be delivered fast, and they fit in the kinds of tight spaces that are common in substations. “It’s not about cost, even though we’re competitive there. It’s about ‘how quick’ and ‘can it fit,’” says Kreikebaum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if the grid’s pinch point shifts? The devices can be quickly moved to another substation. “It’s a Lego-brick build,” says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/owen-wilkes/?originalSubdomain=uk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Owen Wilkes&lt;/a&gt;, National Grid’s director of network design. Wilkes’s team decides where to add equipment based on today’s best projections, but he appreciates the flexibility to respond to unexpected changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Grid’s deployments in 2021 were the highest-voltage installation of SSSCs at the time, and success there is fueling expansion. National Grid now has packs of SmartValves installed at three substations in northern England and under construction at another, with five more installations planned in that area. Smart Wires has also commissioned commercial projects at transmission substations in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dynamic Line Rating Boosts Grid Efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to SSSCs, National Grid has deployed lidar that senses sag on Penwortham’s 275-kV lines—an indication that they’re starting to overheat. The sensors are part of a dynamic line rating system and help grid operators maximize the amount of current that high-voltage lines can carry based on near-real-time weather conditions. (Cooler weather means more capacity.) Now the same technology is being deployed across the B7a—a £1 million investment that is projected to save consumers £33 million annually, says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/corin-ireland-4040b2179/?originalSubdomain=uk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Corin Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, a National Grid optimization engineer with the task of seizing GETs opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a lot of old conductor wires being swapped out for those that can carry more power. National Grid’s business plan calls for 2,416 kilometers of such reconductoring over the coming five years, which is about 20 percent of its system. Scotland’s transmission operators are busy with their own big swaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Rural farmland with shape and rotating wind turbines &#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;80b0b&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/rural-farmland-with-shape-and-rotating-wind-turbines.jpg?id=62286812&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Scottish wind farms have doubled their power output over the past decade, but it often gets stranded due to grid congestion in England.&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;            Andreas Berthold/Alamy        &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while National Grid and NESO are making some of the boldest deployments of GETs in the world, they’re not fully tapping the technologies’ capabilities. That’s partly due to the conservative nature of power utilities, and partly because grid operators already have plenty to keep their eyes on. It also stems from the unknowns that still surround GETs, like whether they might take the grid in unforeseen directions if allowed to respond automatically, or get stuck in a feedback loop responding to each other. Imagine SmartValve controllers at different substations fighting, with one substation jumping to remove impedance that the other just added, causing fluctuating power flows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These technologies operate very quickly, but the computers in the control room are still very reliant on people making decisions,” says Ireland. “So there are time scales that we have to take into consideration when planning and operating the network.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of conservative dispatching leaves value on the table. For example, the dynamic line rating models can spit out new line ratings every 15 minutes, but grid operators get updates only every 24 hours. Fewer updates means fewer opportunities to tap the system’s ability to boost capacity. Similarly, for SmartValves, NESO activates installations at only one substation at a time. And control-room operators turn them on manually, even though the devices could automatically respond to faults within milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Workers in harnesses and hard hats climbing and standing high up on a transmission tower in the countryside.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;9e46e&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-in-harnesses-and-hard-hats-climbing-and-standing-high-up-on-a-transmission-tower-in-the-countryside.jpg?id=62286819&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;National Grid is upgrading transmission lines dating as far back as the 1960s. This includes installing conductors that retain their strength at higher temperatures, allowing them to carry more power.&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;            National Grid Electricity Transmission        &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modeling by Smart Wires and National Grid shows a significant capacity boost across Boundary B7a if Penwortham’s SmartValves were to work in tandem with another set further up the line. For example, when Penwortham is adding impedance to push megawatts off the 275-kV lines, a set closer to Scotland could simultaneously pull the power north, nudging the sum over to the B7a’s eastern circuits. Simulations by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hiorns-6a92b158/?originalSubdomain=uk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Andy Hiorns&lt;/a&gt;, a former National Grid planning director who consults for Smart Wires, suggest that this kind of cooperative action should increase the B7a circuits’ usable capacity by another 250 to 300 MW. “You double the effectiveness by using them as pairs,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating multiple flow controllers may become necessary for unlocking the next boundary en route to London, south of the B7a, called Boundary B8. As dynamic line rating, beefier conductors, and SmartValves send more power across the B7a, lines traversing B8 are reaching their limits. Eventually, every boundary along the route will have to be upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, back at its U.S. headquarters, Smart Wires is developing other applications for its SSSCs, such as filtering out power oscillations that can destabilize grids and reduce allowable transfers. That capability could be unlocked remotely with firmware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also working on a test program that could turn on pairs of SmartValve installations during slack moments when there isn’t much going on in the control rooms. That would give National Grid and NESO operators an opportunity to observe the impacts, and to get more comfortable with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Grid and Smart Wires are also hard at work developing industry-first optimization software for coordinating flow-control devices. “It’s possible to extend the technology from how we’re using it today,” says Ireland at National Grid. “That’s the exciting bit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NESO’s Julian Leslie shares that excitement and says he expects SmartValves to begin working together to ease power through the grid—once the operators have the modeling right and get a little more comfortable with the technology. “It’s a great innovation that has the potential to be really transformational,” he says. “We’re just not quite there yet.” &lt;span class=&#34;ieee-end-mark&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</div>

&lt;i style=&#34;font-size: 0.9em;&#34;&gt;Sample language model responses to different varieties of English and native speaker reactions.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT does amazingly well at communicating with people in English. But whose English?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.similarweb.com/website/chat.openai.com/#geography&#34;&gt;Only 15%&lt;/a&gt; of ChatGPT users are from the US, where Standard American English is the default. But the model is also commonly used in countries and communities where people speak other varieties of English. Over 1 billion people around the world speak varieties such as Indian English, Nigerian English, Irish English, and African-American English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speakers of these non-“standard” varieties often face discrimination in the real world. They’ve been told that the way they speak is &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.2307/3587696&#34;&gt;unprofessional&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.4324/9781410616180&#34;&gt;incorrect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/641206/summary&#34;&gt;discredited as witnesses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203986615-17/linguistic-profiling-john-baugh&#34;&gt;denied housing&lt;/a&gt;–despite &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.routledge.com/Language-Society-and-Power-An-Introduction/Mooney-Evans/p/book/9780367638443&#34;&gt;extensive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.com/books?id=QRFIsGWZ5O4C&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicating that all language varieties are equally complex and legitimate. Discriminating against the way someone speaks is often a proxy for discriminating against their race, ethnicity, or nationality. What if ChatGPT exacerbates this discrimination?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08818&#34;&gt;our recent paper&lt;/a&gt; examines how ChatGPT’s behavior changes in response to text in different varieties of English. We found that ChatGPT responses exhibit consistent and pervasive biases against non-“standard” varieties, including increased stereotyping and demeaning content, poorer comprehension, and condescending responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-study&#34;&gt;Our Study&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We prompted both GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 with text in ten varieties of English: two “standard” varieties, Standard American English (SAE) and Standard British English (SBE); and eight non-“standard” varieties, African-American, Indian, Irish, Jamaican, Kenyan, Nigerian, Scottish, and Singaporean English. Then, we compared the language model responses to the “standard” varieties and the non-“standard” varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we wanted to know whether linguistic features of a variety that are present in the prompt would be retained in GPT-3.5 Turbo responses to that prompt. We annotated the prompts and model responses for linguistic features of each variety and whether they used American or British spelling (e.g., “colour” or “practise”). This helps us understand when ChatGPT imitates or doesn’t imitate a variety, and what factors might influence the degree of imitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we had native speakers of each of the varieties rate model responses for different qualities, both positive (like warmth, comprehension, and naturalness) and negative (like stereotyping, demeaning content, or condescension). Here, we included the original GPT-3.5 responses, plus responses from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 where the models were told to imitate the style of the input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expected ChatGPT to produce Standard American English by default: the model was developed in the US, and Standard American English is likely the best-represented variety in its training data. We indeed found that model responses retain features of SAE far more than any non-“standard” dialect (by a margin of over 60%). But surprisingly, the model &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; imitate other varieties of English, though not consistently. In fact, it imitates varieties with more speakers (such as Nigerian and Indian English) more often than varieties with fewer speakers (such as Jamaican English). That suggests that the training data composition influences responses to non-“standard” dialects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT also defaults to American conventions in ways that could frustrate non-American users. For example, model responses to inputs with British spelling (the default in most non-US countries) almost universally revert to American spelling. That’s a substantial fraction of ChatGPT’s userbase likely hindered by ChatGPT’s refusal to accommodate local writing conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model responses are consistently biased against non-“standard” varieties.&lt;/strong&gt; Default GPT-3.5 responses to non-“standard” varieties consistently exhibit a range of issues: stereotyping (19% worse than for “standard” varieties), demeaning content (25% worse), lack of comprehension (9% worse), and condescending responses (15% worse).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/linguistic-bias/image2.png&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Native speaker ratings of model responses. Responses to non-”standard” varieties (blue) were rated as worse than responses to “standard” varieties (orange) in terms of stereotyping (19% worse), demeaning content (25% worse), comprehension (9% worse), naturalness (8% worse), and condescension (15% worse).&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When GPT-3.5 is prompted to imitate the input dialect, the responses exacerbate stereotyping content (9% worse) and lack of comprehension (6% worse). GPT-4 is a newer, more powerful model than GPT-3.5, so we’d hope that it would improve over GPT-3.5. But although GPT-4 responses imitating the input improve on GPT-3.5 in terms of warmth, comprehension, and friendliness, they exacerbate stereotyping (14% worse than GPT-3.5 for minoritized varieties). That suggests that larger, newer models don’t automatically solve dialect discrimination: in fact, they might make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;implications&#34;&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT can perpetuate linguistic discrimination toward speakers of non-“standard” varieties. If these users have trouble getting ChatGPT to understand them, it’s harder for them to use these tools. That can reinforce barriers against speakers of non-“standard” varieties as AI models become increasingly used in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, stereotyping and demeaning responses perpetuate ideas that speakers of non-“standard” varieties speak less correctly and are less deserving of respect. As language model usage increases globally, these tools risk reinforcing power dynamics and amplifying inequalities that harm minoritized language communities.&lt;/p&gt;

That includes titanium components, which have historically caused trouble for 3D printers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3D printing has used metals included aluminum, powdered steel, and nickel alloys &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-printed-rocket&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;for some time&lt;/a&gt;. While titanium parts are in high demand in fields such as aerospace and health care due to their superior strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and their suitability for complex geometries, the metal has presented challenges for 3D printers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Titanium becomes more reactive at high temperatures and tends to crack when the printed part cools. It can also become brittle as it absorbs hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen during the printing process. Carrington says CMF overcomes these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our primary customers tend to come from the energy, defense, and aerospace industries,” says Carrington. “One large defense contractor recently switched from traditional 3D printing to CMF as it will save them millions and reduce prototyping and parts production by months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How CMF Enhances Titanium 3D Printing Efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CMF combines the flexibility of 3D printing with new powder metallurgy processes to provide strength and greater durability to parts made from titanium and many other metals and alloys. The process uses a combination of proprietary metal powder and polymer binding agents that are fused layer by layer to create high-strength metal components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process begins like any other &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/mechanical-metamaterials-and-other-3d-printing-tech-from-chi-2017&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;3D printing project&lt;/a&gt;: A digital file that represents the desired 3D object directs the actions of a standard industrial 3D printer in laying down a mixture of metal and a plastic binder. A laser lightly fuses each layer of powder into a cohesive solid structure. Excess powder is removed for reuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where CMF differs is that the initial parts generated by this stage of the process are strong enough for grinding, drilling, and milling if required. The parts then soak in a solvent to dissolve the plastic binder. Next, they go into a furnace to burn off any remaining binder, fuse the metal particles, and compact them into a dense metal component. Surface or finishing treatments can then be applied such as polishing and heat treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our cold metal fusion technology offers a process that is at least three times faster and more scalable than any other kind of 3D printing,” says Carrington. “Per-part prices are generally 50 to 60 percent less than alternative metal 3D printing technology. We expect those prices to go down even more as we scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Shiny silver turbine wheel with blades, placed on a dark textured surface.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;ec031&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/shiny-silver-turbine-wheel-with-blades-placed-on-a-dark-textured-surface.jpg?id=62225237&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;3D printing with metal powders such as titanium makes it possible to create parts with complex geometries.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;CADmore Metal&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The material used in CMF was developed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.headmade-materials.de/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Headmade Materials&lt;/a&gt;, a German company. Headmade holds a patent on this 3D printing feedstock, which has been designed for use by the existing ecosystem of 3D printing machines. CADmore Metal serves as the exclusive North American distributor for the metal powders used in CMF. The company can also serve as a systems integrator for the entire process by providing the printing and sintering hardware, the specialized powders, process expertise, training, and technical support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We provide guidance on design optimization and integration with existing workflows to help customers maximize the technology’s benefits,” says Carrington. “If a turbine company comes to us to produce their parts using CMF, we can either build the parts for them as a service or set them up to carry out their own production internally while we supply the powder and support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the global 3D printing market now worth almost US $5 billion and predicted to reach $13 billion by 2035, according to analyst firm &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.idtechex.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IDTechEx&lt;/a&gt;, the arrival of CMF is timely. CADmore Metal just opened North America’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://3dprint.com/316902/cadmore-establishes-first-cold-metal-fusion-facility-in-u-s/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;first CMF application center&lt;/a&gt;, a nearly 280-square-meter (3,000-square-foot) facility in Columbia, S.C. Carrington says that a larger facility will open in 2026 to make room for more material processing and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;</div>

          <div class="tag" style="margin-top:6px">arXiv:2512.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The telecommunications and financial services industries face substantial challenges in inter-operator settlement processes, characterized by extended reconciliation cycles, high transaction costs, and limited real-time transparency. Traditional settlement mechanisms rely on multiple intermediaries and manual procedures, resulting in settlement periods exceeding 120 days with operational costs consuming approximately 5 percent of total revenue. This research presents a blockchain-anchored audit trail model enabling transparent, immutable, and automated inter-operator settlement. The framework leverages distributed ledger technology, smart contract automation, and cryptographic verification to establish a unified, tamper-proof transaction record. Empirical evaluation demonstrates 87 percent reduction in transaction fees, settlement cycle compression from 120 days to 3 minutes, and 100 percent audit trail integrity. Smart contract automation reduces manual intervention by 92 percent and eliminates 88 percent of settlement disputes. Market analysis indicates institutional adoption accelerated from 8 percent in 2020 to 52 percent by April 2024, with projected industry investment reaching 9.2 billion USD annually. The framework addresses scalability (12,000 transactions per second), interoperability, and regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions.</div>

BYD’s real innovation is pulling it into a price range where everyday drivers in Brazil can actually choose ratios of ethanol and gasoline, as well as electric.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;BYD’s Affordable Hybrid Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BYD Song Pro vehicles&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;with this new engine were initially priced in a promotion &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/byd-song-pro-2026-debuts-with-1-electric-engine-5-hp-and-up-to-235-km-in-electric-mode-but-price-is-still-higher-than-that-of-toyota-corolla-cross-afch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;at around US $25,048&lt;/a&gt;, with a list price around $35,000. For comparison, another plug-in hybrid vehicle, Toyota’s 2026 Prius Prime, starts at &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;$33,775. The engine is the product of an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2740741-byd-unveils-gasoline-ethanol-engine-opens-brazil-plant&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;$18.5 million investment by BYD&lt;/a&gt; and a collaboration between Brazilian and Chinese scientists. It&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;adds to Brazil’s history of ethanol use that began in the 1930s and progressed from ethanol-only to flex-fuel vehicles, providing consumers a tool kit to respond to changing fuel prices, ongoing drought like Brazil &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0162-5&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;experienced in the 1980s&lt;/a&gt;, or emissions goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An engine switching between gasoline and ethanol needs&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a sensor that can reconcile two distinct fuel-air mixtures. “Integrating that control system, especially in a hybrid architecture, is not trivial,” says Wooldridge. “But BYD appears to have engineered it in a way that’s cost-effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By leveraging a smaller, downsized hybrid engine, the company is likely able to design the engine to be optimal over a smaller speed map—a narrower, specific range of speeds and power output—avoiding some efficiency compromises that have long plagued flex-fuel power-train engines, says Wooldridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, standard flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs) have an internal combustion engine and can operate on gasoline and any blend of gasoline and ethanol up to 83 percent, &lt;a href=&#34;https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/how-do-flexible-fuel-cars-work&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;according to the U.S. Department of Energy&lt;/a&gt;. FFV engines have only  one fuel system, and mostly use components that are the same as those found in gasoline-only cars. To compensate for ethanol’s different chemical properties and power output compared to gasoline, special components modify the fuel pump and fuel-injection system. In addition, FFV engines have engine control modules&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;calibrated to accommodate ethanol’s higher oxygen content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Flex-fuel gives consumers flexibility,” Wooldridge says. “If you’re using ethanol, you can run at a higher compression ratio, allowing molecules to be squeezed into a smaller space to allow for faster, more powerful and more efficient combustion. Increasing that ratio boosts efficiency and lowers knock—but if you’re also tying in electric drive, the system can stay optimally efficient across different modes,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://history.osu.edu/people/eaglin.5&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jennifer Eaglin&lt;/a&gt;, a historian of Brazilian energy at Ohio State University, in Columbus, says that BYD is tapping into something deeply rooted in the culture of Brazil, the world’s seventh-most populous country (with a population of around 220 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Brazil has built an ethanol-fuel system that’s durable and widespread,” Eaglin says. “It’s no surprise that a company like BYD, recognizing that infrastructure, would innovate to give consumers more options. This isn’t futuristic—it’s a continuation of a long national experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;</div>

          <div class="tag" style="margin-top:6px">&lt;!-- twitter --&gt;












&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on an “alternative” paradigm: &lt;strong&gt;divide and conquer&lt;/strong&gt;. Unlike traditional methods, this algorithm is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; based on temporal difference (TD) learning (which has &lt;a href=&#34;https://seohong.me/blog/q-learning-is-not-yet-scalable/&#34;&gt;scalability challenges&lt;/a&gt;), and scales well to long-horizon tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl-without-td-learning/teaser_short.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i style=&#34;font-size: 0.9em;&#34;&gt;We can do Reinforcement Learning (RL) based on divide and conquer, instead of temporal difference (TD) learning.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-setting-off-policy-rl&#34;&gt;Problem setting: off-policy RL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our problem setting is &lt;strong&gt;off-policy RL&lt;/strong&gt;. Let’s briefly review what this means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two classes of algorithms in RL: on-policy RL and off-policy RL. On-policy RL means we can &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; use fresh data collected by the current policy. In other words, we have to throw away old data each time we update the policy. Algorithms like PPO and GRPO (and policy gradient methods in general) belong to this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off-policy RL means we don’t have this restriction: we can use &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; kind of data, including old experience, human demonstrations, Internet data, and so on. So off-policy RL is more general and flexible than on-policy RL (and of course harder!). Q-learning is the most well-known off-policy RL algorithm. In domains where data collection is expensive (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;robotics&lt;/strong&gt;, dialogue systems, healthcare, etc.), we often have no choice but to use off-policy RL. That’s why it’s such an important problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2025, I think we have reasonably good recipes for scaling up on-policy RL (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, PPO, GRPO, and their variants). However, we still haven’t found a “scalable” &lt;em&gt;off-policy RL&lt;/em&gt; algorithm that scales well to complex, long-horizon tasks. Let me briefly explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;two-paradigms-in-value-learning-temporal-difference-td-and-monte-carlo-mc&#34;&gt;Two paradigms in value learning: Temporal Difference (TD) and Monte Carlo (MC)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In off-policy RL, we typically train a value function using temporal difference (TD) learning (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, Q-learning), with the following Bellman update rule:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{aligned} Q(s, a) \gets r + \gamma \max_{a&#39;} Q(s&#39;, a&#39;), \end{aligned}\]

&lt;p&gt;The problem is this: the error in the next value $Q(s’, a’)$ propagates to the current value $Q(s, a)$ through bootstrapping, and these errors &lt;em&gt;accumulate&lt;/em&gt; over the entire horizon. This is basically what makes TD learning struggle to scale to long-horizon tasks (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://seohong.me/blog/q-learning-is-not-yet-scalable/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; if you’re interested in more details).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate this problem, people have mixed TD learning with Monte Carlo (MC) returns. For example, we can do $n$-step TD learning (TD-$n$):&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{aligned} Q(s_t, a_t) \gets \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \gamma^i r_{t+i} + \gamma^n \max_{a&#39;} Q(s_{t+n}, a&#39;). \end{aligned}\]

&lt;p&gt;Here, we use the actual Monte Carlo return (from the dataset) for the first $n$ steps, and then use the bootstrapped value for the rest of the horizon. This way, we can reduce the number of Bellman recursions by $n$ times, so errors accumulate less. In the extreme case of $n = \infty$, we recover pure Monte Carlo value learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is a reasonable solution (and often &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04168&#34;&gt;works well&lt;/a&gt;), it is highly unsatisfactory. First, it doesn’t &lt;em&gt;fundamentally&lt;/em&gt; solve the error accumulation problem; it only reduces the number of Bellman recursions by a constant factor ($n$). Second, as $n$ grows, we suffer from high variance and suboptimality. So we can’t just set $n$ to a large value, and need to carefully tune it for each task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a fundamentally different way to solve this problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-third-paradigm-divide-and-conquer&#34;&gt;The “Third” Paradigm: Divide and Conquer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My claim is that a &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt; paradigm in value learning, &lt;strong&gt;divide and conquer&lt;/strong&gt;, may provide an ideal solution to off-policy RL that scales to arbitrarily long-horizon tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl-without-td-learning/teaser.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i style=&#34;font-size: 0.9em;&#34;&gt;Divide and conquer reduces the number of Bellman recursions logarithmically.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key idea of divide and conquer is to divide a trajectory into two equal-length segments, and combine their values to update the value of the full trajectory. This way, we can (in theory) reduce the number of Bellman recursions &lt;em&gt;logarithmically&lt;/em&gt; (not linearly!). Moreover, it doesn’t require choosing a hyperparameter like $n$, and it doesn’t necessarily suffer from high variance or suboptimality, unlike $n$-step TD learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, divide and conquer really has all the nice properties we want in value learning. So I’ve long been excited about this high-level idea. The problem was that it wasn’t clear how to actually do this in practice… until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-practical-algorithm&#34;&gt;A practical algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22512&#34;&gt;recent work&lt;/a&gt; co-led with &lt;a href=&#34;https://aober.ai/&#34;&gt;Aditya&lt;/a&gt;, we made meaningful progress toward realizing and scaling up this idea. Specifically, we were able to scale up divide-and-conquer value learning to highly complex tasks (as far as I know, this is the first such work!) at least in one important class of RL problems, &lt;em&gt;goal-conditioned RL&lt;/em&gt;. Goal-conditioned RL aims to learn a policy that can reach any state from any other state. This provides a natural divide-and-conquer structure. Let me explain this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure is as follows. Let’s first assume that the dynamics is deterministic, and denote the shortest path distance (“temporal distance”) between two states $s$ and $g$ as $d^*(s, g)$. Then, it satisfies the triangle inequality:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{aligned} d^*(s, g) \leq d^*(s, w) + d^*(w, g) \end{aligned}\]

&lt;p&gt;for all $s, g, w \in \mathcal{S}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of values, we can equivalently translate this triangle inequality to the following &lt;em&gt;“transitive”&lt;/em&gt; Bellman update rule:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{aligned} 
V(s, g) \gets \begin{cases}
\gamma^0 &amp;amp; \text{if } s = g, \\\\ 
\gamma^1 &amp;amp; \text{if } (s, g) \in \mathcal{E}, \\\\ 
\max_{w \in \mathcal{S}} V(s, w)V(w, g) &amp;amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} 
\end{aligned}\]

&lt;p&gt;where $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of edges in the environment’s transition graph, and $V$ is the value function associated with the sparse reward $r(s, g) = 1(s = g)$. &lt;strong&gt;Intuitively&lt;/strong&gt;, this means that we can update the value of $V(s, g)$ using two “smaller” values: $V(s, w)$ and $V(w, g)$, provided that $w$ is the optimal “midpoint” (subgoal) on the shortest path. This is exactly the divide-and-conquer value update rule that we were looking for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there’s one problem here. The issue is that it’s unclear how to choose the optimal subgoal $w$ in practice. In tabular settings, we can simply enumerate all states to find the optimal $w$ (this is essentially the Floyd-Warshall shortest path algorithm). But in continuous environments with large state spaces, we can’t do this. Basically, this is why previous works have struggled to scale up divide-and-conquer value learning, even though this idea has been around for decades (in fact, it dates back to the very first work in goal-conditioned RL by &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;amp;citation_for_view=IcasIiwAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC&#34;&gt;Kaelbling (1993)&lt;/a&gt; – see &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22512&#34;&gt;our paper&lt;/a&gt; for a further discussion of related works). The main contribution of our work is a practical solution to this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s our key idea: we &lt;em&gt;restrict&lt;/em&gt; the search space of $w$ to the states that appear in the dataset, specifically, those that lie between $s$ and $g$ in the dataset trajectory. Also, instead of searching for the optimal $\text{argmax}_w$, we compute a “soft” $\text{argmax}$ using &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06169&#34;&gt;expectile regression&lt;/a&gt;. Namely, we minimize the following loss:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{aligned} \mathbb{E}\left[\ell^2_\kappa (V(s_i, s_j) - \bar{V}(s_i, s_k) \bar{V}(s_k, s_j))\right], \end{aligned}\]

&lt;p&gt;where $\bar{V}$ is the target value network, $\ell^2_\kappa$ is the expectile loss with an expectile $\kappa$, and the expectation is taken over all $(s_i, s_k, s_j)$ tuples with $i \leq k \leq j$ in a randomly sampled dataset trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has two benefits. First, we don’t need to search over the entire state space. Second, we prevent value overestimation from the $\max$ operator by instead using the “softer” expectile regression. We call this algorithm &lt;strong&gt;Transitive RL (TRL)&lt;/strong&gt;. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22512&#34;&gt;our paper&lt;/a&gt; for more details and further discussions!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see whether our method scales well to complex tasks, we directly evaluated TRL on some of the most challenging tasks in &lt;a href=&#34;https://seohong.me/projects/ogbench/&#34;&gt;OGBench&lt;/a&gt;, a benchmark for offline goal-conditioned RL. We mainly used the hardest versions of humanoidmaze and puzzle tasks with large, 1B-sized datasets. These tasks are highly challenging: they require performing combinatorially complex skills across up to &lt;strong&gt;3,000 environment steps&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl-without-td-learning/table.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i style=&#34;font-size: 0.9em;&#34;&gt;TRL achieves the best performance on highly challenging, long-horizon tasks.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are quite exciting! Compared to many strong baselines across different categories (TD, MC, quasimetric learning, etc.), TRL achieves the best performance on most tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl-without-td-learning/1b.svg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i style=&#34;font-size: 0.9em;&#34;&gt;TRL matches the best, individually tuned TD-$n$, &lt;b&gt;without needing to set $\boldsymbol{n}$&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite plot. We compared TRL with $n$-step TD learning with different values of $n$, from $1$ (pure TD) to $\infty$ (pure MC). The result is really nice. TRL matches the best TD-$n$ on all tasks, &lt;strong&gt;without needing to set $\boldsymbol{n}$&lt;/strong&gt;! This is exactly what we wanted from the divide-and-conquer paradigm. By recursively splitting a trajectory into smaller ones, it can &lt;em&gt;naturally&lt;/em&gt; handle long horizons, without having to arbitrarily choose the length of trajectory chunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has a lot of additional experiments, analyses, and ablations. If you’re interested, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22512&#34;&gt;our paper&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I shared some promising results from our new divide-and-conquer value learning algorithm, Transitive RL. This is just the beginning of the journey. There are many open questions and exciting directions to explore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important question is how to extend TRL to regular, reward-based RL tasks beyond goal-conditioned RL. Would regular RL have a similar divide-and-conquer structure that we can exploit? I’m quite optimistic about this, given that it is possible to convert any reward-based RL task to a goal-conditioned one at least in theory (see page 40 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/view/goalconditioned-rl/&#34;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another important challenge is to deal with stochastic environments. The current version of TRL assumes deterministic dynamics, but many real-world environments are stochastic, mainly due to partial observability. For this, &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17098&#34;&gt;“stochastic” triangle inequalities&lt;/a&gt; might provide some hints.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practically, I think there is still a lot of room to further improve TRL. For example, we can find better ways to choose subgoal candidates (beyond the ones from the same trajectory), further reduce hyperparameters, further stabilize training, and simplify the algorithm even more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I’m really excited about the potential of the divide-and-conquer paradigm. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://seohong.me/blog/q-learning-is-not-yet-scalable/&#34;&gt;still&lt;/a&gt; think one of the most important problems in RL (and even in machine learning) is to find a &lt;em&gt;scalable&lt;/em&gt; off-policy RL algorithm. I don’t know what the final solution will look like, but I do think divide and conquer, or &lt;strong&gt;recursive&lt;/strong&gt; decision-making in general, is one of the strongest candidates toward this holy grail (by the way, I think the other strong contenders are (1) model-based RL and (2) TD learning with some “magic” tricks). Indeed, several recent works in other fields have shown the promise of recursion and divide-and-conquer strategies, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://kvfrans.com/shortcut-models/&#34;&gt;shortcut models&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04761&#34;&gt;log-linear attention&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/&#34;&gt;recursive language models&lt;/a&gt; (and of course, classic algorithms like quicksort, segment trees, FFT, and so on). I hope to see more exciting progress in scalable off-policy RL in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;

          <div class="tag" style="margin-top:6px">&lt;img src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-an-old-fashioned-yellow-and-green-stove-and-oven-with-a-logo-that-says-lionel.jpg?id=62219513&amp;amp;width=2000&amp;amp;height=1500&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduced in 1930 by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lionel.com/about&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lionel Corp.&lt;/a&gt;—better known for its electric model trains—the fully functional toy stove shown at top had two electric burners and an oven that heated to 260 °C. It came with a set of cookware, including a frying pan, a pot with lid, a muffin tin, a tea kettle, and a wooden potato masher. I would have also expected a spoon, whisk, or spatula, but maybe most girls already had those. Just plug in the toy, and housewives-in-training could mimic their mothers frying eggs, baking muffins, or boiling water for tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A brief history of toy stoves&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before electrification, cast-iron toy stoves had become popular in the mid-19th century. At first fueled by coal or alcohol and later by oil or gas, these toy stoves were scaled-down working equivalents of the real thing. Girls could use their stoves along with a toy waffle iron or small skillet to whip up breakfast. If that wasn’t enough fun, they could heat up a miniature flatiron and iron their dolls’ clothes. Designed to help girls understand their domestic duties, these toys were the gendered equivalent of their brothers’ &lt;a href=&#34;https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object/nmah_847046&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;toy steam engines&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re thinking fossil-fuel-powered “educational toys” are a recipe for disaster, you are correct. Many children suffered serious burns and sometimes death by literally playing with fire. Then again, people in the 1950s thought &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/fun-and-uranium-for-the-whole-family-in-this-1950s-science-kit&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;playing with uranium&lt;/a&gt; was safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When electric toy stoves came on the scene in the 1910s, things didn’t get much safer, as the new entrants also lacked basic safety features. The burners on the 1930 Lionel range, for example, could only be turned off or on, but at least kids weren’t cooking over an open flame. At 86 centimeters tall, the Lionel range was also significantly larger than its more diminutive predecessors. Just the right height for young children to cook standing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Photo of a black and silver toy electric stove with two pots plus a book entitled Western Electric Junior Cook Book&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;2fd9c&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-black-and-silver-toy-electric-stove-with-two-pots-plus-a-book-entitled-western-electric-junior-cook-book.jpg?id=62219520&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Western Electric’s Junior Electric Range was demonstrated at an expo in 1915 in New York City.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;The Strong&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well before the Lionel stove, the Western Electric Co. had a cohort of girls demonstrating its Junior Electric Range at the Electrical Exposition held in New York City in 1915. The Junior Electric held its own in a display of regular sewing-machine motors, vacuum cleaners, and electric washing machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Junior Electric stood about 30 cm tall with six burners and an oven. The electric cord plugged into a light fixture socket. Children played with it while sitting on the floor or as it sat on a table. A visitor to the Expo declared the miniature range “the greatest electrical novelty in years.” Cooking by electricity in any form was still innovative—George A. Hughes had introduced his eponymous electric range just five years earlier. When the Junior Electric came along, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/article/the-life-of-american-workers-in-1915.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;less than a third of U.S. households&lt;/a&gt; had been wired for electric lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How electricity turned cooking into a science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason to give little girls working toy stoves was so they could learn how to differentiate between a hot flame and low heat and get a feel for cooking without burning the food. These are skills that come with experience. Directions like “bake until done in a moderate oven,” a common line in 19th-century recipes, require a lot more tacit knowledge than is needed to, say, throw together a modern boxed brownie mix. The latter comes with detailed instructions and assumes you can control your oven temperature to within a few degrees. That type of precision simply didn’t exist in the 19th century, in large part because it was so difficult to calibrate wood- or coal-burning appliances. Girls needed to start young to master these skills by the time they married and were expected to handle the household cooking on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electricity changed the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his comparison of “fireless cookers,” an engineer named &lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6590440&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Percy Wilcox Gumaer&lt;/a&gt; exhaustively tested four different electric ovens and then presented his findings at the 32nd Annual Convention of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (a forerunner of today’s IEEE) on 2 July 1915. At the time, metered electricity was more expensive than gas or coal, so Gumaer investigated the most economical form of cooking with electricity, comparing different approaches such as longer cooking at low heat versus faster cooking in a hotter oven, the effect of heat loss when opening the oven door, and the benefits of searing meat on the stovetop versus in the oven before making a roast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gumaer wasn’t starting from scratch. Similar to how Yoshitada Minami needed to learn the ideal rice recipe before he could design an &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/toshiba-rice-cooker&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;automatic rice cooker&lt;/a&gt;, Gumaer decided that he needed to understand the principles of roasting beef. Minami had turned to his wife, Fumiko, who spent five years researching and testing variations of rice cooking. Gumaer turned to the work of Elizabeth C. Sprague, a research assistant in nutrition investigations at the University of Illinois, and H.S. Grindley, a professor of general chemistry there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their 1907 publication “&lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/cu31924003582503&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A Precise Method of Roasting Beef&lt;/a&gt;,” Sprague and Grindley had defined qualitative terms like medium rare and well done by precisely measuring the internal temperature in the center of the roast. They concluded that beef could be roasted at an oven temperature between 100 and 200 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing that investigation, Gumaer tested 22 roasts at 100, 120, 140, 160, and 180 °C, measuring the time they took to reach rare, medium rare, and well done, and calculating the cost per kilowatt-hour. He repeated his tests for biscuits, bread, and sponge cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you’re wondering, Gumaer determined that cooking with electricity could be a few cents cheaper than other methods if you roasted the beef at 120 °C instead of 180 °C. It’s also more cost-effective to sear beef on the stovetop rather than in the oven. Biscuits tasted best when baked at 200 to 240 °C, while sponge cake was best between 170 and 200 °C. Bread was better at 180 to 240 °C, but too many other factors affected its quality. In true electrical engineering fashion, Gumaer concluded that “it is possible to reduce the art of cooking with electricity to an exact science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Electric toy stoves as educational tools&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This semester, I’m teaching an introductory class on women’s and gender studies, and I told my students about the Lionel toy oven. They were horrified by the inherent danger. One incredulous student kept asking, “This is real? This is not a joke?” Instead of learning to cook with a toy that could heat to 260 °C, many of us grew up with the Easy-Bake Oven. The 1969 model could reach about 177° C with its two 100-watt incandescent light bulbs. That was still hot enough to cause burns, but somehow it seemed safer. (Since 2011, Easy-Bakes have used a heating element instead of lightbulbs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Photo of a box for a purple and green toy oven.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;15cbd&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-box-for-a-purple-and-green-toy-oven.jpg?id=62219526&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;The Queasy Bake Cookerator, designed to whip up “gross-looking, great-tasting snacks,” was marketed to boys. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;The Strong&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Easy-Bake I had wasn’t particularly gendered. It was orange and brown and meant to look like a different new-fangled appliance of the day, the microwave oven. But by the time my students were playing with Easy-Bake Ovens, the models were in the girly hues of pink and purple. In 2002, Hasbro briefly tried to lure boys by releasing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/oven-queasy-bake-cookerator-hasbro-inc/EAGAnW_bfiaP1A&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Queasy Bake Cookerator&lt;/a&gt;, which the company marketed with disgusting-sounding foods like Chocolate Crud Cake and Mucky Mud. The campaign didn’t work, and the toy was soon withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Lionel’s electric toy range didn’t last long on the market. Launched in 1930, it had been discontinued by 1932, but that may have had more to do with timing. The toy cost US $29.50, the equivalent of a men’s suit, a new bed, or a month’s rent. In the midst of a global depression, the toy stove was an extravagance. Lionel reverted to selling electric trains to boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My students discussed whether cooking is still a gendered activity. Although they agreed that meal prep disproportionately falls on women even now, they acknowledged the rise of the male chef and credited televised cooking shows with closing the gender gap. As a surprise, we discovered that one of the students in the class, Haley Mattes, competed in and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ciachef.edu/blog/keeping-chopped-junior-winner-haley-mattes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;won &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chopped Junior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a 12-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haley had a play kitchen as a kid that was entirely fake: fake food, fake pans, fake utensils. She graduated to the Easy-Bake Oven, but really got into cooking the same way girls have done for centuries, by learning beside her grandmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;continuing series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An abridged version of this article appears in the December 2025 print issue as “Too Hot to Handle.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first came across a description of Western Electric’s Junior Electric Range in “The Latest in Current Consuming Devices,” in the November 1915 issue of &lt;em&gt;Electrical Age.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.museumofplay.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Strong National Museum of Play&lt;/a&gt;, in Rochester, N.Y., has a large collection of both cast-iron and electric stoves. The Strong also published two blogs that highlighted Lionel’s toy: “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.museumofplay.org/blog/kids-and-cooking-playing-with-fire/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kids and Cooking&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.museumofplay.org/blog/lionel-for-ladies/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lionel for Ladies?&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Ron Hollander’s &lt;em&gt;All Aboard! The Story of Joshua Lionel Cowen &amp; His Lionel Train Company&lt;/em&gt; (Workman Publishing, 1981) is primarily about toy trains, it includes a few details about how Lionel marketed its electric toy stove to girls.&lt;/p&gt;</div>

          <div class="tag" style="margin-top:6px">&lt;img src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-powerlattice-s-newest-chiplet-on-the-pad-of-a-person-s-pointer-finger.jpg?id=62303380&amp;amp;width=2000&amp;amp;height=1500&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if a GPU in a data center should only require 700 watts to run a large language model, it may realistically need 1,700 watts because of inefficiencies in how electricity reaches it. That’s a problem Peng Zou and his team at startup &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.powerlatticeinc.com/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PowerLattice&lt;/a&gt; say they have solved by miniaturizing and repackaging high-voltage regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company claims that its new &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/chiplet&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;chiplets&lt;/a&gt; deliver up to a 50 percent reduction in power consumption and twice performance per watt by sizing down the voltage conversion process and moving it significantly closer to processors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shrinking and Moving Power Delivery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional systems deliver power to AI chips by converting AC power from the grid into DC power, which then gets transformed again into low-voltage (around one volt) DC, usable by the GPU. With that voltage drop, current must increase to conserve power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exchange happens near the processor, but the current still travels a meaningful distance in its low-voltage state. A high current traveling any distance is bad news, because the system loses power in the form of heat proportional to the current squared. “The closer you get to the processor, the less distance that the high current has to travel, and thus we can reduce the power loss,” says &lt;a href=&#34;https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/people/profile/hanh-phuc-le&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hanh-Phuc Le&lt;/a&gt;, who researches power electronics at the University California, San Diego and has no connection to PowerLattice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the ever-growing &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;power consumption of AI data centers&lt;/a&gt;, “this has almost become a show-stopping issue today,” PowerLattice’s Zou says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zou thinks he and his colleagues have found a way to avoid this huge loss of power. Instead of dropping the voltage a few centimeters away from the processor, they figured out how to do it millimeters away, within the processor’s package. PowerLattice designed tiny power delivery chiplets—shrinking inductors, voltage control circuits, and software-programmable logic into an IC about twice the size of a pencil eraser. The chiplets sit under the processor’s package substrate, to which they’re connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One challenge the minds at PowerLattice faced was how to make inductors smaller without altering their capabilities. Inductors temporarily store energy and then release it smoothly, helping regulators maintain steady outputs. Their physical size directly influences how much energy they can manage, so shrinking them weakens their effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The startup countered this issue by building their inductors from a specialized magnetic alloy that “enables us to run the inductor very efficiently at high frequency,” Zou says. “We can operate at a hundred times higher frequency than the traditional solution.” At higher operating frequencies, circuits can be designed to use an inductor with a much lower inductance, meaning the component itself can be made with less physical material. The alloy is unique because it maintains better magnetic properties than comparable materials at these high frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting chiplets are less than 1/20th the area of today’s voltage regulators, Zou says. And each is only 100 micrometers thick, around the thickness of a strand of hair. Being so tiny allows the chiplets to fit as close as possible to the processor, and the space savings provide valuable real estate to other components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;3D rendering of PowerLattice&#39;s chiplets on the underside of a processor package.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;e0195&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-rendering-of-powerlattice-s-chiplets-on-the-underside-of-a-processor-package.jpg?id=62303434&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt; &lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;PowerLattice’s chiplets would sit on the underside of a GPU’s package to provide power from below.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;PowerLattice&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even at their small size, the proprietary tech is “highly configurable and scalable,” Zou says. Customers can use multiple chiplets for a more comprehensive fix or fewer if their architecture doesn’t require it. “It’s one key differentiator” of PowerLattice’s solution to the voltage regulation problem, according to Zou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employing the chiplets can reduce 50 percent of power needs for an operator, effectively doubling performance, the company claims. But this number seems ambitious to Le. He says that 50 percent power savings “could be achievable, but that means PowerLattice has to have direct control of the load, which includes the processor as well.” The only way he sees it as realistic is if the company has the ability to &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-circuit-to-boost-battery-life&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;manage power supply in real time &lt;/a&gt;depending on a processor’s workload—a technique called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/dynamic-voltage-and-frequency-scaling&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dynamic voltage and frequency scaling&lt;/a&gt;—which PowerLattice does not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Facing Competition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, PowerLattice is in the midst of reliability and validation testing before it releases its first product to customers, in about two years. But bringing the chiplets to market won’t be straightforward because PowerLattice has some big-name competition. Intel, for example, is developing a &lt;a href=&#34;https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/ipla/software-development-platforms/servers/platforms/intel-pentium-silver-and-intel-celeron-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/fully-integrated-voltage-regulator-fivr/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fully Integrated Voltage Regulator&lt;/a&gt;, a device partially devoted to solving the same problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zou doesn’t consider Intel competition because, in addition to the products differing in their approaches to the power delivery problem, he does not believe Intel will be providing its technology to its competitors. “From a market position perspective, we are quite a bit different,” Zou says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, PowerLattice wouldn’t have room to succeed, Le says, because companies that sold processors only ensured reliability for their chips if customers purchased their power supplies as well. “Qualcomm, for example, can sell their processor chip and the vast majority of their customers also have to buy their proprietary Qualcomm power supply management chip because otherwise they would say, ‘We don’t guarantee the reliable operation of the whole system.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, though, there may be hope. “There’s a trend of what we call chiplet implementation, so it is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/intels-view-of-the-chiplet-revolution&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;heterogeneous integration&lt;/a&gt;,” Le says. Customers are mixing and matching components from different companies to achieve better system optimization, he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while notable providers like Intel and Qualcomm may continue to have the upper hand with notable customers, smaller companies—mostly startups—building processors and AI infrastructures will also be power hungry. These groups will need to look for a power supply source, and that’s where PowerLattice and similar companies could come in, Le says. “That’s how the market is. We have a startup working with a startup doing something that actually rivals, and even competes with, some large companies.”&lt;/p&gt;</div>

Although autonomous intelligent systems (AIS) can offer significant benefits, they also can be used unethically. The technology can create &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/real-time-audio-deepfake-vishing&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;deepfakes&lt;/a&gt;, realistic-looking altered images and videos that help spread &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-misinformation-llm-bullshit&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt; and disinformation. Meanwhile, AI systems trained on &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/inclusive-ai&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;biased data can perpetuate discrimination&lt;/a&gt; in hiring, lending, and other practices. And surveillance systems that incorporate AI can lead to misidentification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those issues have led to concerns about AIS trustworthiness, and it has become more crucial for AI developers and companies to ensure the systems they use and sell are ethically sound. To help them, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://standards.ieee.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IEEE Standards Association&lt;/a&gt; (IEEE SA) launched its &lt;a href=&#34;https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/icap/ieee-certifaied/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IEEE CertifAIEd&lt;/a&gt; ethics program, which offers two certifications: one for individuals and one for products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IEEE CertifAIEd was developed by an interdisciplinary group of AI ethics experts. The program is based on IEEE’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://standards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/import/documents/other/ethical-considerations-ai-as-29mar2018.pdf&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AI ethics framework and methodology&lt;/a&gt;, centered around the pillars of accountability, privacy, transparency, and avoiding bias.

When you find yourself in a toxic work environment, what should you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it worth trying to improve things over time, or should you just leave? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difficult truth is that, in nearly every case, the answer is to leave a toxic team as soon as you can. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re earlier in your career, you frankly don’t have much political power in the organization. Any arguments to change team culture or address systemic problems will likely fall on deaf ears. You’ll end up frustrated, and your efforts will be wasted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re more senior, you have some ability to improve processes and relationships on the team. However, if you’re an individual contributor (IC), your capabilities are still limited. There is likely some “low-hanging fruit” of quick improvements to suggest. A few thoughtful pieces of feedback could address many of the problems. If you’ve done that and things are still not getting better, it’s probably time to leave.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re part of upper management, you may have inherited the problem, or maybe you were even brought in to solve it. This is the rare case where you could consider the change scenario and address the broken culture: You have both the context and power to make a difference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world of technology is large, and constantly getting larger. Don’t waste your time on a bad team or with a bad manager. Find another team, company, or start something on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers often hesitate to leave a poor work environment because they’re afraid or unsure about the process of finding something new. That’s a valid concern. However, inertia should not be the reason you stick around in a job. The best careers stem from the excitement of actively choosing your work, not tolerating toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s worth noting that even in a toxic team, you’ll still come across smart and kind people. If you are stuck on a bad team, seek out the people who match your wavelength. These relationships will enable you to find new opportunities when you inevitably decide to leave!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Rahul&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-wie-podcast-women-in-tech&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;IEEE Podcast Focuses on Women in Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you looking for a new podcast to add to your queue?

&lt;i style=&#34;font-size: 0.9em;&#34;&gt;We introduce &lt;b&gt;Anthology&lt;/b&gt;, a method for conditioning LLMs to representative, consistent, and diverse virtual personas by generating and utilizing naturalistic backstories with rich details of individual values and experience.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/virtual_personas/header.png&#34; width=&#34;70%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i style=&#34;font-size: 0.9em;&#34;&gt;We introduce &lt;b&gt;Anthology&lt;/b&gt;, a method for conditioning LLMs to representative, consistent, and diverse virtual personas by generating and utilizing naturalistic backstories with rich details of individual values and experience.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for large language models (LLMs) to be trained on massive text corpora, collectively produced by millions and billions of distinctive human authors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01681&#34;&gt;“Language Models as Agent Models”&lt;/a&gt;, compelling evidence suggests that recent language models could be considered models of &lt;em&gt;agents&lt;/em&gt;: provided with a textual context, LLMs are capable of generating conditional text that represents the characteristics of an agent likely to have produced that context. This suggests that, with appropriate conditioning, LLMs could be guided to approximate the responses of a particular human voice, rather than the &lt;em&gt;mixture of voices&lt;/em&gt; that otherwise emerges. If realized, this capability of LLMs would have significant implications for user research and social sciences—conditioned language models as &lt;strong&gt;virtual personas&lt;/strong&gt; of human subjects could serve as cost-effective pilot studies and supporting best practices in human studies, e.g. the Belmont principles of justice and beneficence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we introduce &lt;strong&gt;Anthology&lt;/strong&gt;, an approach for steering LLMs to representative, consistent, and diverse virtual personas by providing richly detailed life narratives of individuals as conditioning context to models.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
In doing so, we also present methods to generate backstories from LLMs themselves as a means to efficiently produce massive sets covering a wide range of human demographics.
By grounding language models in naturalistic backstories, Anthology allows LLMs to simulate individual human samples with increased fidelity, measured in terms of matching the distributions and consistencies of human responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-approach-anthology&#34;&gt;Our Approach: &lt;em&gt;Anthology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conditioning-language-model-generation-with-individual-life-narratives&#34;&gt;Conditioning Language Model Generation with Individual Life Narratives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant limitation of earlier methods in steering LLMs to virtual personas has been the inability to reliably approximate &lt;strong&gt;individual&lt;/strong&gt; human samples. &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17548&#34;&gt;Prior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06899&#34;&gt;approaches&lt;/a&gt; prompt LLMs with broad demographic information, e.g., “I am a 25-year-old from California. My highest level of education is less than high school,” which are essentially bodies of text generated from a tuple of demographic variables. 
With these methods, we are only able to approximate human samples at a &lt;em&gt;population level&lt;/em&gt;, not at the individual level, which results in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responses prone to LLMs defaulting to stereotypical and/or prototypical portrayals, as they are only conditioned on demographic variables (e.g., race and gender)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inability to provide important metrics of interest such as covariance and statistical significance, as individual responses are required for such compuatations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthology enables the approximation of individual subjects by conditioning with richly detailed backstories. Through these backstories, the model captures implicit and explicit markers of personal identity, including demographic traits and spontaneous references to cultural, socioeconomic backgrounds, and life philosophies. Our approach involves generating a vast set of backstories representing a wide range of demographic attributes via language models queried with unrestricted, open-ended prompts such as, “Tell me about yourself.” We then match virtual personas conditioned by each backstory to real-world survey samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;results-closer-approximation-of-public-opinion-polls&#34;&gt;Results: Closer Approximation of Public Opinion Polls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For evaluation, we compare the effectiveness of different methods for conditioning virtual personas in the context of approximating three Pew Research Center ATP surveys: Waves 34, 92, and 99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/virtual_personas/results.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Results on approximating human responses for Pew Research Center ATP surveys. Boldface and underlined results indicate values closest and the second closest to those of humans, respectively.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As measures of success in approximating human samples with virtual personas, we consider the following metrics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average Wasserstein distance (WD) between response distributions as a measure of representativeness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frobenius norm (Fro.) between correlation matrices as a measure of consistency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cronbach’s alpha as an additional measure of internal consistency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to analyzing virtual subjects, we estimate the lower bounds of each evaluation metric by repeatedly dividing the human population into two equal-sized groups at random and calculating these metrics between the subgroups. 
We take averaged values from 100 iterations to represent the lower-bound estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consistently observe that &lt;em&gt;Anthology&lt;/em&gt; outperforms other conditioning methods with respect to all metrics, for both the Llama-3-70B and the Mixtral-8x22B. 
When comparing two matching methods, the greedy matching method tends to show better performance on the average Wasserstein distance across all Waves. We attribute differences in matching methods to the one-to-one correspondence condition of maximum weight matching and the limited number of virtual users available. Specifically, the weights assigned to matched virtual subjects in maximum weight matching are inevitably lower than those in greedy matching, as the latter relaxes the constraints on one-to-one correspondence. This discrepancy can result in a lower demographic similarity between matched human and virtual users compared to the counterpart from greedy matching. These results suggest that the richness of the generated backstories in our approach elicits more nuanced responses compared to baselines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthology marks a promising new direction in conditioning virtual personas in LLMs that could potentially reshape how we conduct user research, public opinion surveys, and other social science applications by offering a scalable, and at times, ethical alternative to traditional human surveys.
However, the use of Anthology, as in any other application of language models in the social sciences, also brings several considerations to the forefront: although the generated backstories help create more representative personas, there remains a risk of perpetuating biases or infringing on privacy, so results should be used and interpreted with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of future steps, we envision our approach benefiting from a more expansive and diverse set of backstories, each representing a consistent life narrative of individuals.
Additionally, a valuable extension of the work would be to consider free-form response generation, enabling more natural and nuanced persona simulations beyond structured survey formats such as multiple-choice. 
Finally, an exciting next dimension in applying LLMs in behavioral studies would involve simulating longer-term effects, allowing virtual personas to model and retrospectively examine changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these directions present multitudes of technical challenges; please let us know if you are interested in collaborating or want to discuss our work further!&lt;/p&gt;

          <div class="tag" style="margin-top:6px">arXiv:2512.09954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation tactical networks face a critical Anonymity Trilemma: it is impossible to simultaneously achieve strong anonymity, low latency (isochrony), and low bandwidth overhead under a global passive adversary. CIDP breaks this deadlock by injecting physical-layer entropy via rapid antenna sidelobe modulation, enabling near-isochronous, low-overhead anonymous communication. CIDP jointly designs: (a) a Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty network controller that stabilizes queues and maximizes entropy injection; (b) a robust discrete-time Control Barrier Function (RaCBF) filter that provably enforces deterministic jitter bounds for real-time flows despite uncertainty; and (c) a convex Sidelobe Time Modulation (SLTM) optimization that spreads signals into the antenna null-space to mask transmissions. We explicitly augment the classical anonymity bound with a physical-layer equivocation term, showing that rapidly changing sidelobes contribute additional secrecy. Consequently, as the injected physical entropy grows, both latency and dummy overhead can approach zero for a fixed anonymity target. We provide full theoretical proofs of queue stability, barrier-set invariance, and SLTM convexity. Moreover, we quantitatively benchmark our SLTM design against recent LPI/LPD schemes, demonstrating significantly lower intercept probability for comparable overhead. High-fidelity MATLAB/NS-3 simulations and an FPGA prototype validate CIDP: results show approximately 40% larger anonymity sets and 100% compliance with sub-30 ms jitter (compared to a Tor-like baseline), with only about 5% throughput loss. We also outline a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) and FOCI-compliant supply-chain strategy. CIDP is the first architecture that simultaneously addresses strong anonymity, strict isochrony, and spectral efficiency with provable guarantees, making it highly relevant for sovereign JADC2 deployments.</div>

          <div class="tag" style="margin-top:6px">arXiv:2512.10051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting requires models that can efficiently capture complex temporal dependencies, especially in large-scale and high-dimensional settings. While Transformer-based architectures excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity poses limitations on scalability and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DB2-TransF, a novel Transformer-inspired architecture that replaces the self-attention mechanism with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer. This wavelet-based module efficiently captures multi-scale local and global patterns and enhances the modeling of correlations across multiple time series for the time series forecasting task. Extensive experiments on 13 standard forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that DB2-TransF achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy to conventional Transformers, while substantially reducing memory usage for the time series forecasting task. The obtained experimental results position DB2-TransF as a scalable and resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting.

That approach delivered astonishing breakthroughs in &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/large-language-models&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;large language models&lt;/a&gt; (LLMs); &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;n just five years, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;leapt from models like GPT-2, which could hardly mimic coherence, to systems like GPT-5 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;can reason and engage in substantive dialogue. And now early prototypes of AI agents that can navigate codebases or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agents-computer-use&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;browse the web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; point towards an entirely new frontier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But size alone can only take AI so far. The next leap won’t come from bigger models alone&lt;span&gt;. I&lt;/span&gt;t will come from combining ever-better data with worlds we build for models to learn in. And the most important question &lt;span&gt;becomes: What do classrooms for AI look like?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the past few&lt;/span&gt; month&lt;span&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; Silicon Valley has placed its bets, &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-environments-to-train-ai-agents/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;with labs investing billions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in constructing &lt;span&gt;such &lt;/span&gt;classrooms, which are called reinforcement learning (RL) environments. These environments let machines experiment, fail, and improve in realistic digital spaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AI Training: From Data to Experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history of modern AI has unfolded in eras, each defined by the kind of data that the models consumed. First came the age of pretraining on internet-scale datasets. This commodity data allowed machines to mimic human language by recognizing statistical patterns. Then came  &lt;span&gt;data combined&lt;/span&gt; with reinforcement learning from human feedback—a technique that uses crowd workers to grade responses from LLMs—which made AI more useful, responsive, and aligned with human preferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have experienced both eras firsthand. Working in the trenches of model data &lt;span&gt;at &lt;a href=&#34;https://scale.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Scale AI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; exposed us to what many consider the fundamental problem in AI: ensuring that the &lt;span&gt;training &lt;/span&gt;data fueling these models is diverse, accurate, and effective in driving performance gains. Systems trained on clean, structured, expert-labeled data made leaps. Cracking the data problem allowed us to pioneer some of the most critical advancements in LLMs over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, data is still a foundation. It is the raw material from which intelligence is built. But we are entering a new phase where data alone is no longer enough. To unlock the next frontier, we must pair high-quality data with environments that allow limitless interaction, continuous feedback, and learning through action. RL environments don’t replace data; they amplify what data can do by enabling models to apply knowledge, test hypotheses, and refine behaviors in realistic settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How an RL Environment Works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an RL environment, the model learns through a simple loop: it observes the state of the world, takes an action, and receives a reward that indicates whether that action helped accomplish a goal. Over many iterations, the model gradually discovers strategies that lead to better outcomes. The crucial shift is that training becomes interactive—models aren’t just predicting the next token but improving through trial, error, and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, language models can already generate code in a simple chat setting. Place them in a live coding environment&lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;where they can ingest context, run their code, debug errors, and refine their solution&lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;and something changes. They shift from advising to autonomously &lt;span&gt;problem-&lt;/span&gt;solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction matters. In a software-driven world, the ability for AI to generate and test production-level code in vast repositories will mark a &lt;span&gt;major&lt;/span&gt; change in capability. That leap won’t come solely from larger datasets; it will come from immersive environments where agents can experiment, stumble, and learn through iteration—much like human programmers do. The real world of development is messy: Coders have to deal with underspecified bugs, tangled codebases, vague requirements. Teaching AI to handle that mess is the only way it will ever graduate from producing error-prone attempts to generating consistent and reliable solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can AI Handle the Messy Real World?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigating the internet is also messy. Pop-ups, login walls, broken links, and outdated information are woven throughout day-to-day browsing workflows. Humans handle these disruptions almost instinctively, but AI can only develop that capability by training in environments that simulate the web’s unpredictability. Agents must learn how to recover from errors, recognize and persist through user-interface obstacles, and complete multi-step workflows across widely used applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most important environments aren’t public at all. Governments and enterprises are actively building secure simulations where AI can practice high-stakes decision-making without real-world consequences. Consider disaster relief: It would be unthinkable to deploy an untested agent in a live hurricane response. But in a simulated world of ports, roads, and supply chains, an agent can fail a thousand times and gradually get better at crafting the optimal plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every major leap in AI has relied on unseen infrastructure, such as annotators labeling datasets, researchers training reward models, and engineers building scaffoldings for LLMs to use tools and take action. &lt;span&gt;Finding l&lt;/span&gt;arge-volume and high-quality datasets &lt;span&gt;was &lt;/span&gt;once the bottleneck in AI, and solving that problem sparked the previous wave of progress. Today, the bottleneck is not data—it’s building RL environments that are rich, realistic, and truly useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next phase of AI progress&lt;/span&gt; won’t be an accident of scale. It will be the result of combining strong data foundations with interactive environments that teach machines how to act, adapt, and reason across messy real-world scenarios. Coding sandboxes, OS and browser playgrounds, and secure simulations will turn prediction into competence.&lt;/p&gt;</div>

Decades of engineering assumptions, predictable inertia, dispatchable baseload generation, and slow, well-characterized system dynamics, are now eroding as wind and solar become dominant sources of electricity. Grid operators face increasingly steep ramp events, larger frequency excursions, faster transients, and prolonged periods where fossil generation is minimal or absent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this environment, battery energy storage systems (BESS) have emerged as essential tools for maintaining stability. They can respond in milliseconds, deliver precise power control, and operate flexibly across a range of services. But unlike conventional generation, batteries are sensitive to operational history, thermal environment, state of charge window, system architecture, and degradation mechanisms. Their long-term behavior cannot be described by a single model or simple efficiency curve, it is the product of complex electrochemical, thermal, and control interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most laboratory tests and simulations attempt to capture these effects, but they rarely reproduce the operational irregularities of the grid. Batteries in real markets are exposed to rapid fluctuations in power demand, partial state of charge cycling, fast recovery intervals, high-rate events, and unpredictable disturbances. As &lt;a href=&#34;https://sheffield.ac.uk/eee/people/academic-staff/dan-gladwin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Professor Dan Gladwin&lt;/a&gt;, who leads Sheffield’s research into grid-connected energy storage, puts it, “you only understand how storage behaves when you expose it to the conditions it actually sees on the grid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disconnect creates a fundamental challenge for the industry: How can we trust degradation models, lifetime predictions, and operational strategies if they have never been validated against genuine grid behavior?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few research institutions have access to the infrastructure needed to answer that question. &lt;a href=&#34;https://sheffield.ac.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The University of Sheffield&lt;/a&gt; is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Rows of battery racks with red connectors in a power storage facility.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;e842d&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/rows-of-battery-racks-with-red-connectors-in-a-power-storage-facility.jpg?id=62304947&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Sheffield’s Centre for Research into Electrical Energy Storage and Applications (CREESA) operates one of the UK’s only research-led, grid-connected, multi-megawatt battery energy storage testbeds. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;The University of Sheffield&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sheffield’s unique facility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://sheffield.ac.uk/creesa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Centre for Research into Electrical Energy Storage and Applications (CREESA)&lt;/a&gt; operates one of the UK’s only research-led, grid-connected, multi-megawatt battery energy storage testbeds. This environment enables researchers to test storage technologies not just in simulation or controlled cycling rigs, but under full-scale, live grid conditions. As Professor Gladwin notes, “we aim to bridge the gap between controlled laboratory research and the demands of real grid operation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the facility is an 11 kV, 4 MW network connection that provides the electrical and operational realism required for advanced diagnostics, fault studies, control algorithm development, techno-economic analysis, and lifetime modeling. Unlike microgrid scale demonstrators or isolated laboratory benches, Sheffield’s environment allows energy storage assets to interact with the same disturbances, market signals, and grid dynamics they would experience in commercial deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;pull-quote&#34;&gt;“The ability to test at scale, under real operational conditions, is what gives us insights that simulation alone cannot provide.” &lt;strong&gt;—Professor Dan Gladwin, The University of Sheffield&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The facility includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 2 MW / 1 MWh lithium titanate system, among the first independent grid-connected BESS of its kind in the UK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 100 kW second-life EV battery platform, enabling research into reuse, repurposing, and circular-economy models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for flywheel systems, supercapacitors, hybrid architectures, and fuel-cell technologies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than 150 laboratory cell-testing channels, environmental chambers, and impedance spectroscopy equipment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-speed data acquisition and integrated control systems for parameter estimation, thermal analysis, and fault response measurement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure allows Sheffield to operate storage assets directly on the live grid, where they respond to real market signals, deliver contracted power services, and experience genuine frequency deviations, voltage events, and operational disturbances. When controlled experiments are required, the same platform can replay historical grid and market signals, enabling repeatable full power testing under conditions that faithfully reflect commercial operation. This combination provides empirical data of a quality and realism rarely available outside utility-scale deployments, allowing researchers to analyse system behavior at millisecond timescales and gather data at a granularity rarely achievable in conventional laboratory environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Professor Gladwin, “the ability to test at scale, under real operational conditions, is what gives us insights that simulation alone cannot provide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Man in a suit stands in a lab with equipment and computer showing graphics.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;81b46&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-in-a-suit-stands-in-a-lab-with-equipment-and-computer-showing-graphics.jpg?id=62304994&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Dan Gladwin, Professor of Electrical and Control Systems Engineering, leads Sheffield’s research into grid-connected energy storage.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;The University of Sheffield&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Setting the benchmark with grid scale demonstration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Sheffield’s earliest breakthroughs came with the installation of a 2 MW / 1 MWh lithium titanate demonstrator, a first-of-a-kind system installed at a time when the UK had no established standards for BESS connection, safety, or control. Professor Gladwin led the engineering, design, installation, and commissioning of the system, establishing one of the country’s first independent megawatt scale storage platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project provided deep insight into how high-power battery chemistries behave under grid stressors. Researchers observed sub-second response times and measured the system’s capability to deliver synthetic inertia-like behavior. As Gladwin reflects, “that project showed us just how fast and capable storage could be when properly integrated into the grid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the demonstrator’s long-term value has been its continued operation. Over nearly a decade of research, it has served as a platform for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hybridization studies, including battery-flywheel control architectures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Response time optimization for new grid services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Operator training and market integration, exposing control rooms and traders to a live asset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Algorithm development, including dispatch controllers, forecasting tools, and prognostic and health management systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comparative benchmarking, such as evaluation of different lithium-ion chemistries, lead-acid systems, and second-life batteries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recurring finding is that behavior observed on the live grid often differs significantly from what laboratory tests predict. Subtle electrical, thermal, and balance-of-plant interactions that barely register in controlled experiments can become important at megawatt-scale, especially when systems are exposed to rapid cycling, fluctuating set-points, or tightly coupled control actions. Variations in efficiency, cooling system response, and auxiliary power demand can also amplify these effects under real operating stress. As Professor Gladwin notes, “phenomena that never appear in a lab can dominate behavior at megawatt scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These real-world insights feed directly into improved system design. By understanding how efficiency losses, thermal behavior, auxiliary systems, and control interactions emerge at scale, researchers can refine both the assumptions and architecture of future deployments. This closes the loop between application and design, ensuring that new storage systems can be engineered for the operational conditions they will genuinely encounter rather than idealized laboratory expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ensuring longevity with advanced diagnostics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Battery testing unit with connected cables and a metal duct.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;260ac&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/battery-testing-unit-with-connected-cables-and-a-metal-duct.jpg?id=62304950&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Sheffield’s Centre for Research into Electrical Energy Storage and Applications (CREESA) enables researchers to test storage technologies not just in simulation or controlled cycling rigs, but under full-scale, live grid conditions.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;The University of Sheffield&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ensuring the long-term reliability of storage requires understanding how systems age under the conditions they actually face. Sheffield’s research combines high-resolution laboratory testing with empirical data from full-scale grid-connected assets, building a comprehensive approach to diagnostics and prognostics. In Gladwin’s words, “A model is only as good as the data and conditions that shape it. To predict lifetime with confidence, we need laboratory measurements, full-scale testing, and validation under real-world operating conditions working together.”&lt;p&gt;A major focus is accurate state estimation during highly dynamic operation. Using advanced observers, Kalman filtering, and hybrid physics-ML approaches, the team has developed methods that deliver reliable SOC, SOH and SOP estimates during rapid power swings, irregular cycling, and noisy conditions where traditional methods break down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key contribution is understanding cell-to-cell divergence in large strings. Sheffield’s data shows how imbalance accelerates near SOC extremes, how thermal gradients drive uneven ageing, and how current distribution causes long-term drift. These insights inform balancing strategies that improve usable capacity and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheffield has also strengthened lifetime and degradation modeling by incorporating real grid behavior directly into the framework. By analyzing actual market signals, frequency deviations, and dispatch patterns, the team uncovers ageing mechanisms that do not appear during controlled laboratory cycling and would otherwise remain hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These contributions fall into four core areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;State Estimation and Parameter Identification&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Robust SOC/SOH estimation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Online parameter identification for equivalent circuit models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Power capability prediction using transient excitation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data selection strategies under noise and variability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Degradation and Lifetime Modelling&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Degradation models built on real frequency and market data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analysis of micro cycling and asymmetric duty cycles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hybrid physics-ML forecasting models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Thermal and Imbalance Behavior&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Characterizing thermal gradients in containerized systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understanding cell imbalance in large-scale systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mitigation strategies at the cell and module level&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coupled thermal-electrical behavior under fast cycling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Hybrid Systems and Multi-Technology Optimization&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Battery-flywheel coordination strategies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Techno-economic modeling for hybrid assets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dispatch optimization using evolutionary algorithms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Control schemes that extend lifetime and enhance service performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond grid-connected systems, Sheffield’s diagnostic methods have also proved valuable in off-grid environments. A key example is the collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mopo.co/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MOPO&lt;/a&gt;, a company deploying pay-per-swap lithium-ion battery packs in low-income communities across Sub-Saharan Africa. These batteries face deep cycling, variable user behavior, and sustained high temperatures, all without active cooling or controlled environments. The team’s techniques in cell characterization, parameter estimation, and in-situ health tracking have helped extend the usable life of MOPO’s battery packs. “By applying our know-how, we can make these battery-swap packs clean, safe, and significantly more affordable than petrol and diesel generators for the communities that rely on them,” says Professor Gladwin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; style=&#34;display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;Beyond grid-connected systems, Sheffield’s diagnostic methods have also proved valuable in off-grid environments. A key example is the collaboration with MOPO, a company deploying pay-per-swap lithium-ion battery packs in low-income communities across Sub-Saharan Africa. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-photo-credit&#34;&gt;MOPO&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collaboration and the global future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A defining strength of Sheffield’s approach is its close integration with industry, system operators, technology developers, and service providers. Over the past decade, its grid-connected testbed has enabled organisations to trial control algorithms, commission their first battery assets, test market participation strategies, and validate performance under real operational constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These partnerships have produced practical engineering outcomes, including improved dispatch strategies, refined control architectures, validated installation and commissioning methods, and a clearer understanding of degradation under real-world market operation. According to Gladwin, “It is a two-way relationship, we bring the analytical and research tools, industry brings the operational context and scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;A man in high-visibility jacket stands by a blue and white shipping container.&#34; class=&#34;rm-shortcode&#34; id=&#34;6a6ee&#34; src=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-man-in-high-visibility-jacket-stands-by-a-blue-and-white-shipping-container.jpg?id=62304989&amp;amp;width=980&#34; /&gt;&lt;small class=&#34;image-media media-caption&#34;&gt;One of Sheffield’s earliest breakthroughs came with the installation of a 2 MW / 1 MWh lithium titanate demonstrator.

It continues to shape best practice in lifetime modelling, hybrid system control, diagnostics, and operational optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As electricity systems worldwide move toward net zero, the need for validated models, proven control algorithms, and empirical understanding will only grow. Sheffield’s combination of full-scale infrastructure, long-term datasets, and collaborative research culture ensures it will remain at the forefront of developing storage technologies that perform reliably in the environments that matter most, the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</div>

Abstract: The latency and power consumption of large language models (LLMs) are major constraints when serving them across a wide spectrum of hardware platforms, from mobile edge devices to cloud GPU clusters. Benchmarking is crucial for optimizing efficiency in both model deployment and next-generation model development. To address this need, we open-source a simple profiling tool, \textbf{ELANA}, for evaluating LLMs. ELANA is designed as a lightweight, academic-friendly profiler for analyzing model size, key-value (KV) cache size, prefilling latency (Time-to-first-token, TTFT), generation latency (Time-per-output-token, TPOT), and end-to-end latency (Time-to-last-token, TTLT) of LLMs on both multi-GPU and edge GPU platforms. It supports all publicly available models on Hugging Face and offers a simple command-line interface, along with optional energy consumption logging. Moreover, ELANA is fully compatible with popular Hugging Face APIs and can be easily customized or adapted to compressed or low bit-width models, making it ideal for research on efficient LLMs or for small-scale proof-of-concept studies. We release the ELANA profiling tool at: https://github.com/enyac-group/Elana.</div>

          <div class="tag" style="margin-top:6px">arXiv:2512.09959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organizations are increasingly sharing large volumes of sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII), like health records, with each other to better manage their services. Protecting PII data has become increasingly important in today&#39;s digital age, and several regulations have been formulated to ensure the secure exchange and management of sensitive personal data. However, at times some of these regulations are at loggerheads with each other, like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Cures Act; and this adds complexity to the already challenging task of Health Data compliance. As public concern regarding sensitive data breaches grows, finding solutions that streamline compliance processes and enhance individual privacy is crucial. We have developed a novel TRUsted Compliance Enforcement (TRUCE) framework for secure data exchange which aims to automate compliance procedures and enhance trusted data management within organizations. The TRUCE framework reasons over contexts of data exchange and assesses the trust score of users and the veracity of data based on corresponding regulations. This framework, developed using approaches from AI/Knowledge representation and Semantic Web technologies, includes a trust management method that incorporates static ground truth, represented by regulations such as HIPAA, and dynamic ground truth, defined by an organization&#39;s policies. In this paper, we present our framework in detail along with the validation against the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Data Usage Agreement (DUA) on CDC Contact Tracing patient data, up to one million patient records. TRUCE service will streamline compliance efforts and ensure adherence to privacy regulations and can be used by organizations to manage compliance of large velocity data exchange in real time.</div>

Abstract: Learning is most effective when it's connected to relevant, relatable examples that resonate with learners on a personal level. However, existing educational AI tools don't focus on generating examples or adapting to learners' changing understanding, struggles, or growing skills. We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals. Our demonstration will show how ExaCraft's examples evolve from basic concepts to advanced technical implementations, responding to topic repetition, regeneration requests, and topic progression patterns in different use cases.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09931,"Akaash Chatterjee (Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur), Suman Kundu (Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur)","cs.AI,cs.HC",arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.09931v1""}}"

Abstract: Fact-checking health-related claims has become increasingly critical as misinformation proliferates online. Effective verification requires both the retrieval of high-quality evidence and rigorous reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework for health misinformation detection: Agreement Score Prediction followed by Multi-Agent Debate. In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance. When this score indicates insufficient consensus-falling below a predefined threshold-the system proceeds to a second stage. Multiple agents engage in structured debate to synthesize conflicting evidence and generate well-reasoned verdicts with explicit justifications. Experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the value of combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning for complex verification tasks.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09935,"Chih-Han Chen, Chen-Han Tsai, Yu-Shao Peng","cs.AI,cs.LG",arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.09935v1""}}"

Abstract: Short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA) is critical for secure power system operation. While classical machine learning-based methods have demonstrated strong performance, they still face challenges in robustness under adversarial conditions. This paper proposes QSTAformer-a tailored quantum-enhanced Transformer architecture that embeds parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) into attention mechanisms-for robust and efficient STVSA. A dedicated adversarial training strategy is developed to defend against both white-box and gray-box attacks. Furthermore, diverse PQC architectures are benchmarked to explore trade-offs between expressiveness, convergence, and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate the adversarial vulnerability of quantum machine learning-based STVSA. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that QSTAformer achieves competitive accuracy, reduced complexity, and stronger robustness, underscoring its potential for secure and scalable STVSA under adversarial conditions.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09936,"Yang Li, Chong Ma, Yuanzheng Li, Sen Li, Yanbo Chen, Zhaoyang Dong","eess.SY,cs.LG,cs.SY,quant-ph",arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.09936v1""}}"

Abstract: The telecommunications and financial services industries face substantial challenges in inter-operator settlement processes, characterized by extended reconciliation cycles, high transaction costs, and limited real-time transparency. Traditional settlement mechanisms rely on multiple intermediaries and manual procedures, resulting in settlement periods exceeding 120 days with operational costs consuming approximately 5 percent of total revenue. This research presents a blockchain-anchored audit trail model enabling transparent, immutable, and automated inter-operator settlement. The framework leverages distributed ledger technology, smart contract automation, and cryptographic verification to establish a unified, tamper-proof transaction record. Empirical evaluation demonstrates 87 percent reduction in transaction fees, settlement cycle compression from 120 days to 3 minutes, and 100 percent audit trail integrity. Smart contract automation reduces manual intervention by 92 percent and eliminates 88 percent of settlement disputes. Market analysis indicates institutional adoption accelerated from 8 percent in 2020 to 52 percent by April 2024, with projected industry investment reaching 9.2 billion USD annually.

Abstract: Reinsurance decision-making exhibits the core structural properties that motivate multi-agent models: distributed and asymmetric information, partial observability, heterogeneous epistemic responsibilities, simulator-driven environment dynamics, and binding prudential and regulatory constraints. Deterministic workflow automation cannot meet these requirements, as it lacks the epistemic flexibility, cooperative coordination mechanisms, and norm-sensitive behaviour required for institutional risk-transfer.
  We propose the Reinsurance Constrained Multi-Agent Simulation Process (R-CMASP), a formal model that extends stochastic games and Dec-POMDPs by adding three missing elements: (i) simulator-coupled transition dynamics grounded in catastrophe, capital, and portfolio engines; (ii) role-specialized agents with structured observability, belief updates, and typed communication; and (iii) a normative feasibility layer encoding solvency, regulatory, and organizational rules as admissibility constraints on joint actions.
  Using LLM-based agents with tool access and typed message protocols, we show in a domain-calibrated synthetic environment that governed multi-agent coordination yields more stable, coherent, and norm-adherent behaviour than deterministic automation or monolithic LLM baselines--reducing pricing variance, improving capital efficiency, and increasing clause-interpretation accuracy. Embedding prudential norms as admissibility constraints and structuring communication into typed acts measurably enhances equilibrium stability.
  Overall, the results suggest that regulated, simulator-driven decision environments are most naturally modelled as norm-governed, simulator-coupled multi-agent systems.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09939,Stella C.

Abstract: In this paper we study a basic and natural question about Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, which has applications to the study of Matching Vector based Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes. For integers m and r, define a delta function on {0,1}^r to be a function f: Z_m^r -> C with f(0) = 1 and f(x) = 0 for all nonzero Boolean x. The basic question we study is how small the Fourier sparsity of a delta function can be; namely how sparse such an f can be in the Fourier basis?
  In addition to being intrinsically interesting and natural, such questions arise naturally when studying ""S-decoding polynomials"" for the known matching vector families. Finding S-decoding polynomials of reduced sparsity, which corresponds to finding delta functions with low Fourier sparsity, would improve the current best PIR schemes.
  We show nontrivial upper and lower bounds on the Fourier sparsity of delta functions. Our proofs are elementary and clean. These results imply limitations on improving Matching Vector PIR schemes simply by finding better S-decoding polynomials. In particular, there are no S-decoding polynomials that can make Matching Vector PIRs based on the known matching vector families achieve polylogarithmic communication with a constant number of servers.

Abstract: Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity.

Abstract: The latency and power consumption of large language models (LLMs) are major constraints when serving them across a wide spectrum of hardware platforms, from mobile edge devices to cloud GPU clusters. Benchmarking is crucial for optimizing efficiency in both model deployment and next-generation model development. To address this need, we open-source a simple profiling tool, \textbf{ELANA}, for evaluating LLMs. ELANA is designed as a lightweight, academic-friendly profiler for analyzing model size, key-value (KV) cache size, prefilling latency (Time-to-first-token, TTFT), generation latency (Time-per-output-token, TPOT), and end-to-end latency (Time-to-last-token, TTLT) of LLMs on both multi-GPU and edge GPU platforms. It supports all publicly available models on Hugging Face and offers a simple command-line interface, along with optional energy consumption logging. Moreover, ELANA is fully compatible with popular Hugging Face APIs and can be easily customized or adapted to compressed or low bit-width models, making it ideal for research on efficient LLMs or for small-scale proof-of-concept studies.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have demonstrated strong capability in modeling complex semantics across multi-type nodes and relations. However, their scalability to large-scale graphs remains challenging due to structural redundancy and high-dimensional node features. Existing graph condensation approaches, such as GCond, are primarily developed for homogeneous graphs and rely on gradient matching, resulting in considerable computational, memory, and optimization overhead. We propose HGC-Herd, a training-free condensation framework that generates compact yet informative heterogeneous graphs while maintaining both semantic and structural fidelity.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific data points from a trained model to satisfy privacy, copyright, and safety requirements. In real deployments, providers distribute a global model to many edge devices, where each client personalizes the model using private data. When a deletion request is issued, clients may ignore it or falsely claim compliance, and providers cannot check their parameters or data. This makes verification difficult, especially because personalized models must forget the targeted samples while preserving local utility, and verification must remain lightweight on edge devices.
  We introduce ZK APEX, a zero-shot personalized unlearning method that operates directly on the personalized model without retraining. ZK APEX combines sparse masking on the provider side with a small Group OBS compensation step on the client side, using a blockwise empirical Fisher matrix to create a curvature-aware update designed for low overhead. Paired with Halo2 zero-knowledge proofs, it enables the provider to verify that the correct unlearning transformation was applied without revealing any private data or personalized parameters.
  On Vision Transformer classification tasks, ZK APEX recovers nearly all personalization accuracy while effectively removing the targeted information. Applied to the OPT125M generative model trained on code data, it recovers around seventy percent of the original accuracy. Proof generation for the ViT case completes in about two hours, more than ten million times faster than retraining-based checks, with less than one gigabyte of memory use and proof sizes around four hundred megabytes. These results show the first practical framework for verifiable personalized unlearning on edge devices.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09953,"Mohammad M Maheri, Sunil Cotterill, Alex Davidson, Hamed Haddadi","cs.CR,cs.AI,cs.LG",arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.09953v1""}}"

Abstract: Next-generation tactical networks face a critical Anonymity Trilemma: it is impossible to simultaneously achieve strong anonymity, low latency (isochrony), and low bandwidth overhead under a global passive adversary. CIDP breaks this deadlock by injecting physical-layer entropy via rapid antenna sidelobe modulation, enabling near-isochronous, low-overhead anonymous communication. CIDP jointly designs: (a) a Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty network controller that stabilizes queues and maximizes entropy injection; (b) a robust discrete-time Control Barrier Function (RaCBF) filter that provably enforces deterministic jitter bounds for real-time flows despite uncertainty; and (c) a convex Sidelobe Time Modulation (SLTM) optimization that spreads signals into the antenna null-space to mask transmissions. We explicitly augment the classical anonymity bound with a physical-layer equivocation term, showing that rapidly changing sidelobes contribute additional secrecy. Consequently, as the injected physical entropy grows, both latency and dummy overhead can approach zero for a fixed anonymity target. We provide full theoretical proofs of queue stability, barrier-set invariance, and SLTM convexity. Moreover, we quantitatively benchmark our SLTM design against recent LPI/LPD schemes, demonstrating significantly lower intercept probability for comparable overhead. High-fidelity MATLAB/NS-3 simulations and an FPGA prototype validate CIDP: results show approximately 40% larger anonymity sets and 100% compliance with sub-30 ms jitter (compared to a Tor-like baseline), with only about 5% throughput loss. We also outline a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) and FOCI-compliant supply-chain strategy. CIDP is the first architecture that simultaneously addresses strong anonymity, strict isochrony, and spectral efficiency with provable guarantees, making it highly relevant for sovereign JADC2 deployments.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09954,Pravin G,cs.CR,arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.09954v1""}}"

Abstract: Access control policies are vital for securing modern cloud computing, where organizations must manage access to sensitive data across thousands of users in distributed system settings. Cloud administrators typically write and update policies manually, which can be an error-prone and time-consuming process and can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. Existing approaches based on symbolic analysis have demon- strated success in automated debugging and repairing access control policies; however, their generalizability is limited in the context of cloud-based access control. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been utilized for automated program repair; however, their applicability to repairing cloud access control policies remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CloudFix, the first automated policy repair framework for cloud access control that combines formal methods with LLMs. Given an access control policy and a specification of allowed and denied access requests, CloudFix employs Formal Methods-based Fault Localization to identify faulty statements in the policy and leverages LLMs to generate potential repairs, which are then verified using SMT solvers. To evaluate CloudFix, we curated a dataset of 282 real-world AWS access control policies extracted from forum posts and augmented them with synthetically generated request sets based on real scenarios. Our experimental results show that CloudFix improves repair accuracy over a Baseline implementation across varying request sizes. Our work is the first to leverage LLMs for policy repair, showcasing the effectiveness of LLMs for access control and enabling efficient and automated repair of cloud access control policies.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) is emerging as a key enabler for intelligent, secure, and privacy-preserving model training in next-generation 6G networks. By leveraging the computational advantages of quantum devices, QFL offers significant improvements in learning efficiency and resilience against quantum-era threats. However, future 6G environments are expected to be highly dynamic, decentralized, and data-intensive, which necessitates moving beyond traditional centralized federated learning frameworks. To meet this demand, blockchain technology provides a decentralized, tamper-resistant infrastructure capable of enabling trustless collaboration among distributed quantum edge devices. This paper presents QFLchain, a novel framework that integrates QFL with blockchain to support scalable and secure 6G intelligence. In this work, we investigate four key pillars of \textit{QFLchain} in the 6G context: (i) communication and consensus overhead, (ii) scalability and storage overhead, (iii) energy inefficiency, and (iv) security vulnerability.

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly sharing large volumes of sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII), like health records, with each other to better manage their services. Protecting PII data has become increasingly important in today's digital age, and several regulations have been formulated to ensure the secure exchange and management of sensitive personal data. However, at times some of these regulations are at loggerheads with each other, like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Cures Act; and this adds complexity to the already challenging task of Health Data compliance. As public concern regarding sensitive data breaches grows, finding solutions that streamline compliance processes and enhance individual privacy is crucial. We have developed a novel TRUsted Compliance Enforcement (TRUCE) framework for secure data exchange which aims to automate compliance procedures and enhance trusted data management within organizations. The TRUCE framework reasons over contexts of data exchange and assesses the trust score of users and the veracity of data based on corresponding regulations. This framework, developed using approaches from AI/Knowledge representation and Semantic Web technologies, includes a trust management method that incorporates static ground truth, represented by regulations such as HIPAA, and dynamic ground truth, defined by an organization's policies. In this paper, we present our framework in detail along with the validation against the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Data Usage Agreement (DUA) on CDC Contact Tracing patient data, up to one million patient records.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Web3.0 is transforming the Internet from a centralized structure to decentralized, which empowers users with unprecedented self-sovereignty over their own data. However, in the context of decentralized data access within Web3.0, it is imperative to cope with efficiency concerns caused by the replication of redundant data, as well as security vulnerabilities caused by data inconsistency. To address these challenges, we develop a Trustworthy Decentralized Cooperative Caching (TDC-Cache) framework for Web3.0 to ensure efficient caching and enhance system resilience against adversarial threats. This framework features a two-layer architecture, wherein the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) layer serves as a trusted intermediary platform for decentralized caching, bridging the contents from decentralized storage and the content requests from users. In light of the complexity of Web3.0 network topologies and data flows, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Decentralized Caching (DRL-DC) for TDC-Cache to dynamically optimize caching strategies of distributed oracles. Furthermore, we develop a Proof of Cooperative Learning (PoCL) consensus to maintain the consistency of decentralized caching decisions within DON. Experimental results show that, compared with existing approaches, the proposed framework reduces average access latency by 20%, increases the cache hit rate by at most 18%, and improves the average success consensus rate by 10%. Overall, this paper serves as a first foray into the investigation of decentralized caching framework and strategy for Web3.0.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09961,"Jinyu Chen, Long Shi, Taotao Wang, Jiaheng Wang, Wei Zhang","cs.DC,cs.LG",arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.09961v1""}}"

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their high computational demands pose significant challenges for real-time inference, especially in multi-user server speculative decoding and resource-constrained environments. Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate LLM inference by using lightweight draft models to generate candidate tokens, which are subsequently verified by a larger, more accurate model. However, ensuring both high goodput (the effective rate of accepted tokens) and fairness across multiple draft servers cooperating with a central verification server remains an open challenge. This paper introduces GOODSPEED, a novel distributed inference framework that optimizes goodput through adaptive speculative decoding. GOODSPEED employs a central verification server that coordinates a set of heterogeneous draft servers, each running a small language model to generate speculative tokens. To manage resource allocation effectively, GOODSPEED incorporates a gradient scheduling algorithm that dynamically assigns token verification tasks, maximizing a logarithmic utility function to ensure proportional fairness across servers. By processing speculative outputs from all draft servers in parallel, the framework enables efficient collaboration between the verification server and distributed draft generators, streamlining both latency and throughput. Through rigorous fluid sample path analysis, we show that GOODSPEED converges to the optimal goodput allocation in steady-state conditions and maintains near-optimal performance with provably bounded error under dynamic workloads. These results demonstrate that GOODSPEED provides a scalable, fair and efficient solution for multi- in distributed LLM inference systems.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09963,"Phuong Tran, Tzu-Hao Liu, Long Tan Le, Tung-Anh Nguyen, Van Quan La, Eason Yu, Han Shu, Choong Seon Hong, Nguyen H.

Abstract: A hybrid computational approach that integrates the finite element method (FEM) with least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) is introduced to solve partial differential equations. The method combines FEM's ability to provide the nodal solutions and LSSVR with higher-order Legendre polynomial kernels to deliver a closed-form analytical solution for interpolation between the nodes. The hybrid approach implements element-wise enhancement (super-resolution) of a given numerical solution, resulting in high resolution accuracy, while maintaining consistency with FEM nodal values at element boundaries. It can adapt any low-order FEM code to obtain high-order resolution by leveraging localized kernel refinement and parallel computation without additional implementation overhead. Therefore, effective inference/post-processing of the obtained super-resolved solution is possible. Evaluation results show that the hybrid FEM-LSSVR approach can achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to the base FEM solution. Comparable accuracy is a achieved when comparing the hybrid solution with a standalone FEM result with the same polynomial basis function order. The convergence studies were conducted for four elliptic boundary value problems to demonstrate the method's ability, accuracy, and reliability. Finally, the algorithm can be directly used as a plug-and-play method for super-resolving low-order numerical solvers and for super-resolution of expensive/under-resolved experimental data.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09967,"Maryam Babaei, Peter Rucz, Manfred Kaltenbacher, Stefan Schoder","math.NA,cs.NA,physics.comp-ph",arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.09967v1""}}"

Abstract: Eye tracking for wearable systems demands low latency and milliwatt-level power, but conventional frame-based pipelines struggle with motion blur, high compute cost, and limited temporal resolution.

Our models obtain 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching the accuracy of the application-specific neuromorphic system, Retina (3.24px), while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x, compared to the closest ANN variant of the proposed model.

Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability-efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs); however, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the ""curse of dimensionality,"" rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms.

Abstract: The efficiency of modern machine intelligence depends on high accuracy with minimal computational cost. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), synaptic delays are crucial for encoding temporal structure, yet existing models treat them as fully trainable, unconstrained parameters, leading to large memory footprints, higher computational demand, and a departure from biological plausibility. In the brain, however, delays arise from physical distances between neurons embedded in space. Building on this principle, we introduce Spatial Spiking Neural Networks (SpSNNs), a framework in which neurons learn coordinates in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and delays emerge from inter-neuron distances. This replaces per-synapse delay learning with position learning, substantially reducing parameter count while retaining temporal expressiveness. Across the Yin-Yang and Spiking Heidelberg Digits benchmarks, SpSNNs outperform SNNs with unconstrained delays despite using far fewer parameters. Performance consistently peaks in 2D and 3D networks rather than infinite-dimensional delay spaces, revealing a geometric regularization effect. Moreover, dynamically sparsified SpSNNs maintain full accuracy even at 90% sparsity, matching standard delay-trained SNNs while using up to 18x fewer parameters. Because learned spatial layouts map naturally onto hardware geometries, SpSNNs lend themselves to efficient neuromorphic implementation. Methodologically, SpSNNs compute exact delay gradients via automatic differentiation with custom-derived rules, supporting arbitrary neuron models and architectures.

Abstract: Inspired by how humans combine direct interaction with action-free experience (e.g., videos), we study world models that learn from heterogeneous data. Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines. These results show that latent actions enable training on both passive and interactive data, which makes world models learn more efficiently.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10016,"Marvin Alles, Xingyuan Zhang, Patrick van der Smagt, Philip Becker-Ehmck",cs.LG,arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.10016v1""}}"

Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are central to secure and privacy-preserving computation, with zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs emerging as leading frameworks offering distinct trade-offs in efficiency, scalability, and trust assumptions. While their theoretical foundations are well studied, practical performance under real-world conditions remains less understood.
  In this work, we present a systematic, implementation-level comparison of zk-SNARKs (Groth16) and zk-STARKs using publicly available reference implementations on a consumer-grade ARM platform. Our empirical evaluation covers proof generation time, verification latency, proof size, and CPU profiling. Results show that zk-SNARKs generate proofs 68x faster with 123x smaller proof size, but verify slower and require trusted setup, whereas zk-STARKs, despite larger proofs and slower generation, verify faster and remain transparent and post-quantum secure. Profiling further identifies distinct computational bottlenecks across the two systems, underscoring how execution models and implementation details significantly affect real-world performance.

We validate the accuracy, efficiency, and consistency of the solver on models with up to five subsystems, and compare its performance against two state-of-the-art agent-based methods: Tau-leaping and hybrid methods.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI and GenAI tools has extended to the Chrome Web Store. Cybercriminals are exploiting this trend, deploying malicious Chrome extensions posing as AI tools or impersonating popular GenAI models to target users. These extensions often appear legitimate while secretly exfiltrating sensitive data or redirecting users web traffic to attacker-controlled domains.
  To examine the impact of this trend on the browser extension ecosystem, we curated a dataset of 5,551 AI-themed extensions released over a nine-month period to the Chrome Web Store. Using a multi-signal detection methodology that combines manifest analysis, domain reputation, and runtime network behavior, supplemented with human review, we identified 154 previously undetected malicious Chrome extensions. Together with extensions known from public threat research disclosures, this resulted in a final set of 341 malicious extensions for analysis. Of these, 29 were GenAI-related, forming the focus of our in-depth analysis and disclosure.
  We deconstruct representative GenAI cases, including Supersonic AI, DeepSeek AI | Free AI Assistant, and Perplexity Search, to illustrate attacker techniques such as Adversary-in-the-Browser, impersonation, bait-and-switch updates, query hijacking, and redirection.

Abstract: Weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD) has gained attention as a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised methods, providing both efficiency and high accuracy. Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10031,"Woojin Lee, Hyugjae Chang, Jaeho Moon, Jaehyup Lee, Munchurl Kim","cs.CV,cs.AI",arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.10031v1""}}"

Abstract: Accelerated gradient methods like Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) achieve faster convergence on well-conditioned problems but often diverge on ill-conditioned or non-convex landscapes due to aggressive momentum accumulation. We propose Heavy-Ball Synthetic Gradient Extrapolation (HB-SGE), a robust first-order method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation. Unlike classical momentum methods that accumulate historical gradients, HB-SGE estimates future gradient directions using local Taylor approximations, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability. We prove convergence guarantees for strongly convex functions and demonstrate empirically that HB-SGE prevents divergence on problems where NAG and standard momentum fail. On ill-conditioned quadratics (condition number $\kappa=50$), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while both SGD and NAG diverge. On the non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE achieves convergence in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps. While NAG remains faster on well-conditioned problems, HB-SGE provides a robust alternative with speedup over SGD across diverse landscapes, requiring only $O(d)$ memory overhead and the same hyperparameters as standard momentum.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10033,Sarwan Ali,cs.LG,arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.10033v1""}}"

Abstract: Force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are indispensable for probing the structure, dynamics, and functions of biomolecular systems, including proteins and protein-ligand complexes. Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results. We evaluated its performance across twelve benchmark systems of varying complexity, assessing success rate, efficiency, and adaptability. DynaMate reliably performed full MD simulations, corrected runtime errors through iterative reasoning, and produced meaningful analyses of protein-ligand interactions.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is integral for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) builds on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by fine-tuning LLMs on preference datasets while regularizing the policy towards a mixture of reference models to leverage their collective desirable properties. However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy.

By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines.

While open-weight LLMs enable local deployment, no single model dominates all tasks, motivating ensemble approaches. However, existing LLM ensembles focus on text generation or classification, leaving NER under-explored. In this context, this work proposes a novel three-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using similarly capable, locally run LLMs. Our method outperforms individual LLMs in four out of five Portuguese NER datasets by leveraging a heuristic to select optimal model combinations with minimal annotated data. Moreover, we show that ensembles obtained on different source datasets generally outperform individual LLMs in cross-dataset configurations, potentially eliminating the need for annotated data for the current task.

This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates.

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires models that can efficiently capture complex temporal dependencies, especially in large-scale and high-dimensional settings. While Transformer-based architectures excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity poses limitations on scalability and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DB2-TransF, a novel Transformer-inspired architecture that replaces the self-attention mechanism with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer. This wavelet-based module efficiently captures multi-scale local and global patterns and enhances the modeling of correlations across multiple time series for the time series forecasting task. Extensive experiments on 13 standard forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that DB2-TransF achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy to conventional Transformers, while substantially reducing memory usage for the time series forecasting task. The obtained experimental results position DB2-TransF as a scalable and resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) is inherently sequential, creating a latency bottleneck that scales linearly with output length. While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.
  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone. Our results demonstrate that PDT achieves effective self-correction, reaching \textbf{77.8\% precision} in coverage prediction and recovering approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights. This establishes PDT as a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10054,Logan Robbins,"cs.AI,cs.CL",arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.10054v1""}}"

Abstract: Autoregressive forecasting is central to predictive control in diabetes and hemodynamic management, where different operating zones carry different clinical risks. Standard models trained with teacher forcing suffer from exposure bias, yielding unstable multi-step forecasts for closed-loop use. We introduce Soft-Token Trajectory Forecasting (SoTra), which propagates continuous probability distributions (``soft tokens'') to mitigate exposure bias and learn calibrated, uncertainty-aware trajectories. A risk-aware decoding module then minimizes expected clinical harm. In glucose forecasting, SoTra reduces average zone-based risk by 18\%; in blood-pressure forecasting, it lowers effective clinical risk by approximately 15\%.

Abstract: While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, ""aligned"" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.
  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10058,"Dani Roytburg, Beck Miller","cs.AI,cs.CY,cs.HC,cs.SI",arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.10058v1""}}"

The method combines rational minimax approximations with upward and downward recurrence relations. The non-negative real axis is partitioned into three regions, $[0,\infty\rangle = A\cup B\cup C$, where regions $A$ and $B$ are treated using rational minimax approximations and region $C$ by an asymptotic approximation. This formulation avoids lookup tables and irregular memory access, making it well suited hardware with high maximum throughput and low latency. The rational minimax coefficients are generated using the rational Remez algorithm.

We benchmark \textsc{Text2Graph} on a zero-shot setting using five datasets spanning topic classification and sentiment analysis tasks, comparing multiple variants against other zero-shot approaches for text classification.

Abstract: Covering spaces are a fundamental tool in algebraic topology because of the close relationship they bear with the fundamental groups of spaces. Indeed, they are in correspondence with the subgroups of the fundamental group: this is known as the Galois correspondence. In particular, the covering space corresponding to the trivial group is the universal covering, which is a ""1-connected"" variant of the original space, in the sense that it has the same homotopy groups, except for the first one which is trivial. In this article, we formalize this correspondence in homotopy type theory, a variant of Martin-L\""of type theory in which types can be interpreted as spaces (up to homotopy). Along the way, we develop an n-dimensional generalization of covering spaces. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we formally classify the covering of lens spaces and explain how to construct the Poincar\'e homology sphere.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10064,"Samuel Mimram, \'Emile Oleon","cs.LO,math.AT",arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.10064v1""}}"

Abstract: We investigate how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes of human conversational partners inferred from indirect cues such as names and occupations. We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations. Our study further highlights that models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases, with implications for fairness when applied at scale.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10065,"Paul Bouchaud, Pedro Ramaciotti","cs.AI,cs.HC",arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.10065v1""}}"

Neverthe- less, these models still encounter difficulties in achieving human-like composi- tional generalization. In this study, we propose a new method called Independent Density Estimation (IDE) to tackle this challenge. IDE aims to learn the connec- tion between individual words in a sentence and the corresponding features in an image, enabling compositional generalization. We build two models based on the philosophy of IDE. The first one utilizes fully disentangled visual representations as input, and the second leverages a Variational Auto-Encoder to obtain partially disentangled features from raw images. Additionally, we propose an entropy- based compositional inference method to combine predictions of each word in the sentence.

Although MAPF is NP-hard, the hardness of solving individual instances varies significantly, revealing a gap between theoretical complexity and actual hardness. This paper outlines three key research challenges in MAPF empirical hardness to understand such phenomena. The first challenge, known as algorithm selection, is determining the best-performing algorithms for a given instance. The second challenge is understanding the key instance features that affect MAPF empirical hardness, such as structural properties like phase transition and backbone/backdoor. The third challenge is how to leverage our knowledge of MAPF empirical hardness to effectively generate hard MAPF instances or diverse benchmark datasets.

Abstract: This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations.

Abstract: Learning Analytics (LA) has rapidly expanded through practical and technological innovation, yet its foundational identity has remained theoretically under-specified. This paper addresses this gap by proposing the first axiomatic theory that formally defines the essential structure, scope, and limitations of LA. Derived from the psychological definition of learning and the methodological requirements of LA, the framework consists of five axioms specifying discrete observation, experience construction, state transition, and inference. From these axioms, we derive a set of theorems and propositions that clarify the epistemological stance of LA, including the inherent unobservability of learner states, the irreducibility of temporal order, constraints on reachable states, and the impossibility of deterministically predicting future learning. We further define LA structure and LA practice as formal objects, demonstrating the sufficiency and necessity of the axioms and showing that diverse LA approaches -- such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and dashboards -- can be uniformly explained within this framework. The theory provides guiding principles for designing analytic methods and interpreting learning data while avoiding naive behaviorism and category errors by establishing an explicit theoretical inference layer between observations and states. This work positions LA as a rigorous science of state transition systems based on observability, establishing the theoretical foundation necessary for the field's maturation as a scholarly discipline.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10081,"Kensuke Takii, Changhao Liang, Hiroaki Ogata","cs.CY,cs.AI,stat.ML",arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.10081v1""}}"

Our focus is on computing constrained minimizers of functionals - or, equivalently, by considering the associated Euler-Lagrange equations - the solution of a class of eigenvalue problems that may involve nonlinearities in the eigenfunctions. We introduce metric-driven methods for such problems via Riemannian gradient techniques, leveraging the idea that gradients can be represented in different metrics (so-called Sobolev gradients) to accelerate convergence. We show that the choice of metric not only leads to specific metric-driven iterative schemes, but also induces approximation spaces with enhanced properties, particularly in low-regularity regimes or when the solution exhibits heterogeneous multiscale features. In fact, we recover a well-known class of multiscale spaces based on the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD), now derived from a new perspective.

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) serves as the primary public transportation system in the Greater Boston Area, with the Green Line representing one of the oldest and most complex rapid transit systems in the network. This paper presents a network-based risk and resilience assessment of the MBTA Green Line using graph theory, network metrics, and the Model-Based Risk Analysis (MBRA) tool. The original 70-station Green Line network is simplified into a 17-node model, and key metrics, including degree centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, spectral radius, node robustness, and blocking nodes, are computed using Python-based analysis. Critical vulnerability is derived using the MBRA resiliency equation, and random, targeted, and cyber-physical attack scenarios are evaluated. The results identify North Station, Government Center, Haymarket, Copley, and Kenmore as the most critical nodes.

Abstract: Growing interest in semiconductor workforce development has generated demand for platforms capable of supporting large numbers of independent hardware designs for research and training without imposing high per-project overhead. Traditional multi-project wafer (MPW) services based solely on physical co-placement have historically met this need, yet their scalability breaks down as project counts rise. Recent efforts towards scalable chip tapeouts mitigate these limitations by integrating many small designs within a shared die and attempt to amortize costly resources such as IO pads and memory macros. However, foundational principles for arranging, linking, and validating such densely integrated design sites have received limited systematic investigation. This work presents a new approach with three key techniques to address this gap. First, we establish a structured formulation of the design space that enables automated, algorithm-driven packing of many projects, replacing manual layout practices.

Third, we provide a practical approach for on-chip power domains enabling per-project power characterization at a standard laboratory bench and requiring no expertise in low-power ASIC design.

Abstract: Analyzing large-scale text corpora is a core challenge in machine learning, crucial for tasks like identifying undesirable model behaviors or biases in training data. Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding ""trigger"" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10092,"Nick Jiang, Xiaoqing Sun, Lisa Dunlap, Lewis Smith, Neel Nanda","cs.AI,cs.LG",arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.10092v1""}}"

Abstract: Maximal extractable value opportunities often induce spam in Layer-2 blockchains: many identical transactions are submitted near simultaneously, most of which revert, wasting blockspace. We study Timeboost, a mechanism on Arbitrum that auctions a timestamp advantage, crucial under first-come first-served sequencing rules. We develop a game-theoretic model in which users choose the number of transaction copies to submit, and extend upon the baseline setting by modeling the Timeboost auction and subsequent transaction submission behavior. We show that Timeboost reduces spam and increases sequencer/DAO revenue in equilibrium relative to the baseline, transferring user payments from revert costs to auction bids. Empirically, we assemble mempool data from multiple Layer-2 networks, measuring spam via identical transactions submitted in narrow time intervals, and conduct an event study around Timeboost adoption on Arbitrum using other L2s as contemporaneous benchmarks. We find a decline in MEV-related spam and an increase in revenue on Arbitrum post-adoption, consistent with model predictions.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10094,Brian Zhu,cs.GT,arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.10094v1""}}"

Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Environment Gaussian and a hybrid rendering pipeline that decomposes rendering into diffuse and specular components, enabling physically grounded specular synthesis via rasterization and ray tracing.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable image-based diagnosis remains a fundamental challenge in medical AI, particularly un- der domain shifts and rare-class conditions. Deep learning mod- els often struggle with real-world distribution changes, exhibit bias against infrequent pathologies, and lack the transparency required for deployment in safety-critical clinical environments. We introduce MedXAI (An Explainable Framework for Med- ical Imaging Classification), a unified expert knowledge based framework that integrates deep vision models with clinician- derived expert knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare- class bias, and provide human-understandable explanations by localizing the relevant diagnostic features rather than relying on technical post-hoc methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, LIME). We evaluate MedXAI across heterogeneous modalities on two challenging tasks: (i) Seizure Onset Zone localization from resting-state fMRI, and (ii) Diabetic Retinopathy grading. Ex periments on ten multicenter datasets show consistent gains, including a 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization and a 10% improvmnet in F1 score of rare class, substantially outperforming strong deep learning baselines. Ablations confirm that the symbolic components act as effective clinical priors and regularizers, improving robustness under distribution shift.

Abstract: Nonprehensile manipulation, such as pushing objects across cluttered environments, presents a challenging control problem due to complex contact dynamics and long-horizon planning requirements. In this work, we propose HeRD, a hierarchical reinforcement learning-diffusion policy that decomposes pushing tasks into two levels: high-level goal selection and low-level trajectory generation. We employ a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) agent to select intermediate spatial goals, and a low-level goal-conditioned diffusion model to generate feasible, efficient trajectories to reach them.
  This architecture combines the long-term reward maximizing behaviour of RL with the generative capabilities of diffusion models. We evaluate our method in a 2D simulation environment and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in success rate, path efficiency, and generalization across multiple environment configurations. Our results suggest that hierarchical control with generative low-level planning is a promising direction for scalable, goal-directed nonprehensile manipulation.

Abstract: Email phishing is one of the most prevalent and globally consequential vectors of cyber intrusion. As systems increasingly deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) applications, these systems face evolving phishing email threats that exploit their fundamental architectures. Current LLMs require substantial hardening before deployment in email security systems, particularly against coordinated multi-vector attacks that exploit architectural vulnerabilities. This paper proposes LLMPEA, an LLM-based framework to detect phishing email attacks across multiple attack vectors, including prompt injection, text refinement, and multilingual attacks. We evaluate three frontier LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Grok-3) and comprehensive prompting design to assess their feasibility, robustness, and limitations against phishing email attacks. Our empirical analysis reveals that LLMs can detect the phishing email over 90% accuracy while we also highlight that LLM-based phishing email detection systems could be exploited by adversarial attack, prompt injection, and multilingual attacks. Our findings provide critical insights for LLM-based phishing detection in real-world settings where attackers exploit multiple vulnerabilities in combination.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10104,"Najmul Hassan, Prashanth BusiReddyGari, Haitao Zhao, Yihao Ren, Jinsheng Xu, Shaohu Zhang","cs.CR,cs.IR",arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.10104v1""}}"

Abstract: Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded within digital communication ecosystems, yet its structure and spread remain difficult to study. This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.
  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10105,"Soorya Ram Shimgekar, Abhay Goyal, Lam Yin Cheung, Roy Ka-Wei Lee, Koustuv Saha, Pi Zonooz, Navin Kumar",cs.AI,arxiv.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""arXiv CS"",""url"":""http://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""academic""},""raw"":{""id"":""oai:arXiv.org:2512.10105v1""}}"

Abstract: Studying how recommendation systems reshape social networks is difficult on live platforms: confounds abound, and controlled experiments risk user harm. We present an agent-based simulator where content production, tie formation, and a graph attention network (GAT) recommender co-evolve in a closed loop. We calibrate parameters using Mastodon data and validate out-of-sample against Bluesky (4--6\% error on structural metrics; 10--15\% on held-out temporal splits). Across 18 configurations at 100 agents, we find that \emph{activation timing} affects outcomes: introducing recommendations at $t=10$ vs.\ $t=40$ decreases transitivity by 10\% while engagement differs by $<$8\%. Delaying activation increases content diversity by 9\% while reducing modularity by 4\%. Scaling experiments ($n$ up to 5,000) show the effect persists but attenuates.

Decades of engineering assumptions, predictable inertia, dispatchable baseload generation, and slow, well-characterized system dynamics, are now eroding as wind and solar become dominant sources of electricity. Grid operators face increasingly steep ramp events, larger frequency excursions, faster transients, and prolonged periods where fossil generation is minimal or absent.</p><p>In this environment, battery energy storage systems (BESS) have emerged as essential tools for maintaining stability. They can respond in milliseconds, deliver precise power control, and operate flexibly across a range of services. But unlike conventional generation, batteries are sensitive to operational history, thermal environment, state of charge window, system architecture, and degradation mechanisms. Their long-term behavior cannot be described by a single model or simple efficiency curve, it is the product of complex electrochemical, thermal, and control interactions.</p><p>Most laboratory tests and simulations attempt to capture these effects, but they rarely reproduce the operational irregularities of the grid. Batteries in real markets are exposed to rapid fluctuations in power demand, partial state of charge cycling, fast recovery intervals, high-rate events, and unpredictable disturbances. As <a href=""https://sheffield.ac.uk/eee/people/academic-staff/dan-gladwin"" target=""_blank"">Professor Dan Gladwin</a>, who leads Sheffield’s research into grid-connected energy storage, puts it, “you only understand how storage behaves when you expose it to the conditions it actually sees on the grid.”</p><p>This disconnect creates a fundamental challenge for the industry: How can we trust degradation models, lifetime predictions, and operational strategies if they have never been validated against genuine grid behavior?</p><p>Few research institutions have access to the infrastructure needed to answer that question. <a href=""https://sheffield.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"">The University of Sheffield</a> is one of them.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Rows of battery racks with red connectors in a power storage facility."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""e842d"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/rows-of-battery-racks-with-red-connectors-in-a-power-storage-facility.jpg?id=62304947&amp;width=980"" /><small class=""image-media media-caption"">Sheffield’s Centre for Research into Electrical Energy Storage and Applications (CREESA) operates one of the UK’s only research-led, grid-connected, multi-megawatt battery energy storage testbeds. </small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">The University of Sheffield</small></p><h2>Sheffield’s unique facility</h2><p>The <a href=""https://sheffield.ac.uk/creesa"" target=""_blank"">Centre for Research into Electrical Energy Storage and Applications (CREESA)</a> operates one of the UK’s only research-led, grid-connected, multi-megawatt battery energy storage testbeds.

Professor Gladwin led the engineering, design, installation, and commissioning of the system, establishing one of the country’s first independent megawatt scale storage platforms.</p><p>The project provided deep insight into how high-power battery chemistries behave under grid stressors. Researchers observed sub-second response times and measured the system’s capability to deliver synthetic inertia-like behavior. As Gladwin reflects, “that project showed us just how fast and capable storage could be when properly integrated into the grid.”</p><p>But the demonstrator’s long-term value has been its continued operation. Over nearly a decade of research, it has served as a platform for:</p><ul><li>Hybridization studies, including battery-flywheel control architectures</li><li>Response time optimization for new grid services</li><li>Operator training and market integration, exposing control rooms and traders to a live asset</li><li>Algorithm development, including dispatch controllers, forecasting tools, and prognostic and health management systems</li><li>Comparative benchmarking, such as evaluation of different lithium-ion chemistries, lead-acid systems, and second-life batteries</li></ul><p>A recurring finding is that behavior observed on the live grid often differs significantly from what laboratory tests predict. Subtle electrical, thermal, and balance-of-plant interactions that barely register in controlled experiments can become important at megawatt-scale, especially when systems are exposed to rapid cycling, fluctuating set-points, or tightly coupled control actions. Variations in efficiency, cooling system response, and auxiliary power demand can also amplify these effects under real operating stress. As Professor Gladwin notes, “phenomena that never appear in a lab can dominate behavior at megawatt scale.”</p><p>These real-world insights feed directly into improved system design. By understanding how efficiency losses, thermal behavior, auxiliary systems, and control interactions emerge at scale, researchers can refine both the assumptions and architecture of future deployments. This closes the loop between application and design, ensuring that new storage systems can be engineered for the operational conditions they will genuinely encounter rather than idealized laboratory expectations.</p><h2>Ensuring longevity with advanced diagnostics</h2><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25"" style=""float: left;""> <img alt=""Battery testing unit with connected cables and a metal duct."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""260ac"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/battery-testing-unit-with-connected-cables-and-a-metal-duct.jpg?id=62304950&amp;width=980"" /><small class=""image-media media-caption"">Sheffield’s Centre for Research into Electrical Energy Storage and Applications (CREESA) enables researchers to test storage technologies not just in simulation or controlled cycling rigs, but under full-scale, live grid conditions.</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">The University of Sheffield</small></p>Ensuring the long-term reliability of storage requires understanding how systems age under the conditions they actually face. Sheffield’s research combines high-resolution laboratory testing with empirical data from full-scale grid-connected assets, building a comprehensive approach to diagnostics and prognostics. In Gladwin’s words, “A model is only as good as the data and conditions that shape it. To predict lifetime with confidence, we need laboratory measurements, full-scale testing, and validation under real-world operating conditions working together.”<p>A major focus is accurate state estimation during highly dynamic operation. Using advanced observers, Kalman filtering, and hybrid physics-ML approaches, the team has developed methods that deliver reliable SOC, SOH and SOP estimates during rapid power swings, irregular cycling, and noisy conditions where traditional methods break down.</p><p>Another key contribution is understanding cell-to-cell divergence in large strings. Sheffield’s data shows how imbalance accelerates near SOC extremes, how thermal gradients drive uneven ageing, and how current distribution causes long-term drift. These insights inform balancing strategies that improve usable capacity and safety.</p><p>Sheffield has also strengthened lifetime and degradation modeling by incorporating real grid behavior directly into the framework. By analyzing actual market signals, frequency deviations, and dispatch patterns, the team uncovers ageing mechanisms that do not appear during controlled laboratory cycling and would otherwise remain hidden.</p><p>These contributions fall into four core areas:</p><h4>State Estimation and Parameter Identification</h4><ul><li>Robust SOC/SOH estimation</li><li>Online parameter identification for equivalent circuit models</li><li>Power capability prediction using transient excitation</li><li>Data selection strategies under noise and variability</li></ul><h4>Degradation and Lifetime Modelling</h4><ul><li>Degradation models built on real frequency and market data</li><li>Analysis of micro cycling and asymmetric duty cycles</li><li>Hybrid physics-ML forecasting models</li></ul><h4>Thermal and Imbalance Behavior</h4><ul><li>Characterizing thermal gradients in containerized systems</li><li>Understanding cell imbalance in large-scale systems</li><li>Mitigation strategies at the cell and module level</li><li>Coupled thermal-electrical behavior under fast cycling</li></ul><h4>Hybrid Systems and Multi-Technology Optimization</h4><ul><li>Battery-flywheel coordination strategies</li><li>Techno-economic modeling for hybrid assets</li><li>Dispatch optimization using evolutionary algorithms</li><li>Control schemes that extend lifetime and enhance service performance</li></ul><p>Beyond grid-connected systems, Sheffield’s diagnostic methods have also proved valuable in off-grid environments. A key example is the collaboration with <a href=""https://mopo.co/"" target=""_blank"">MOPO</a>, a company deploying pay-per-swap lithium-ion battery packs in low-income communities across Sub-Saharan Africa. These batteries face deep cycling, variable user behavior, and sustained high temperatures, all without active cooling or controlled environments. The team’s techniques in cell characterization, parameter estimation, and in-situ health tracking have helped extend the usable life of MOPO’s battery packs. “By applying our know-how, we can make these battery-swap packs clean, safe, and significantly more affordable than petrol and diesel generators for the communities that rely on them,” says Professor Gladwin.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube""> <span class=""rm-shortcode"" style=""display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;""></span><small class=""image-media media-caption"">Beyond grid-connected systems, Sheffield’s diagnostic methods have also proved valuable in off-grid environments.

Motives varied, but entertainment as well as the display of technical prowess mattered.

Another member cofounded <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/"" target=""_blank"">Cisco Systems</a>, which got its start manufacturing Internet routers and other networking hardware and is now a multibillion-dollar business.

The most imposing of these was a <a href=""https://tjsawyer.com/B205home.php"" target=""_blank"">Burroughs Datatron 205</a>, a computer first manufactured in the mid-1950s and based on vacuum tubes.

Developed starting in 1959 by computer scientist <a href=""https://garfield.library.upenn.edu/commentaries/tsv11(06)p09y19970317.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Calvin Mooers</a>, TRAC was an efficient language amenable to being run on machines that had relatively little memory.

Pietras/The Evening Times; Trenton Free Public Library</small></p><p>The bargain Kagan struck with the RESISTORS was unusual for several reasons. First, Kagan was gay, a fact that the teens (and their parents) were aware of but which, by all accounts, bothered no one. When the Hopewell Valley Jaycee-ettes held a house tour in April 1966, the brochure encouraged people to visit Kagan’s “unique bachelor setting” that he shared with artist George Furnish. Furnish passed away around the time the RESISTORS were forming, and the grieving Kagan assumed multiple roles for the group: guru, mentor, publicity agent, and landlord. Kagan provided the space, while the teens were responsible for maintaining both it and the equipment as well as covering the cost of electricity.</p><p>Most amateur computer clubs of the era were masculine spaces, but photographs of the RESISTORS almost always show one or more young women working at a terminal or solving a programming problem. When it came to deciding whose turn it was to use a machine, <a href=""https://cals.cornell.edu/people/jean-hunter"" target=""_blank"">Jean Hunter</a>—later a professor of biological and environmental engineering at Cornell—likened it to social time-sharing that required “beating people over the head to make them give you a turn.” <a href=""https://www.johnlevine.com/about.phtml"" target=""_blank"">John R. Levine</a>, who was a RESISTOR before studying computer science at Yale and later coauthoring the bestseller <a href=""https://www.dummies.com/book/technology/internet-basics/the-internet-for-dummies-14th-edition-281740/"" target=""_blank""><em><em>The</em></em> <em><em>Internet for Dummies</em></em></a>, recalled, “We were so nerdy that it didn’t occur to us that girls [would] be any different in terms of what they could do.”</p><p>There were also efforts to recruit African American teens from schools in Trenton. One of these kids, Joseph Tulloch, provided quirky, Dr. Seuss-like illustrations for a programming manual that Kagan and the teens assembled and published. Tulloch later became a programmer for the state of New Jersey.</p><p>New members were initiated into the group by having an omega sign, the engineer’s symbol for electrical resistance, drawn on their face with a Magic Marker (these were teenagers after all). One of the first things a new member would learn was how to use TRAC to write programs. For his part, Kagan held a dim view of traditional learning as practiced in local classrooms. He instead insisted that the RESISTORS learn by doing. The group’s pedagogical approach came from the African American motto “Each one, teach one.” As one member recalled, “If you want to teach someone how to do something, you had to let them sit at the keyboard.”</p><p>The RESISTORS’ location in the Princeton area contributed to their success. Several members had parents employed at nearby technology companies, such as AT&amp;T and RCA. Others, such as Nat Kuhn, had parents who worked at <a href=""https://www.princeton.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Princeton University</a>. Kuhn’s father was Thomas Kuhn, a historian and author of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/thomas-kuhn-structure-scientific-revolutions"" target=""_blank""><em><em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em></em></a> (1962), the landmark book that introduced “paradigm shift” into the vernacular.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""A black and white photo of a young boy who is smiling and pointing a pen device at a computer screen.

His goal was to design and implement a universal text handling, publishing, and globally connected electronic library system, which he named <a href=""https://www.xanadu.net/"" target=""_blank"">Project Xanadu</a>, from Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan.” (It’s also the name of Charles Foster Kane’s mansion in Orson Welles’s 1941 classic, <em><em>Citizen Kane</em></em>.) Xanadu would turn into Nelson’s lifelong obsession.</p><h2>A convergence of art and computers</h2><p>The catalyst that brought Nelson together with Claude Kagan and the RESISTORS wasn’t some new computer but an avant-garde art show. In the fall of 1970, a lavish new exhibition titled <a href=""https://www.artforum.com/events/software-234492/"" target=""_blank""><em><em>Software</em></em></a> opened at the <a href=""https://thejewishmuseum.org/"" target=""_blank"">Jewish Museum</a> in New York City.

Burnham, in turn, was inspired by <a href=""https://museum.dataart.com/short-stories/norbert-wiener"" target=""_blank"">Norbert Wiener</a>’s cybernetic concepts and wanted to explore how conceptual artists might experiment with new computing technologies, such as “real-time computing” and “interactivity,” in a gallery setting. The exhibition gave thousands of visitors an opportunity to see, and in some cases use, minicomputers, teletype equipment, high-speed copy machines, and closed-circuit television.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25"" style=""float: left;""> <img alt=""Black and white photo shows 3 teenagers looking at a 1960s computer terminal."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""0b1ac"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-shows-3-teenagers-looking-at-a-1960s-computer-terminal.jpg?id=62293557&amp;width=980"" /></p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25"" style=""float: left;""> <img alt=""Black and white photo shows a large room decorated with hand-written posters and people seated at tables.

As he later wrote in his influential 1974 book <a href=""https://computerlibbook.com/"" target=""_blank""><em><em>Computer Lib/Dream Machines</em></em></a>, “Some people are too proud to ask children for information. This is dumb. Information is where you find it.” For Agnes Denes, a Hungarian-born conceptual artist, the teens coded a minicomputer to animate triangles on a screen for a piece called <em><em>Trigonal Ballet</em></em>. For conceptual artist Carl Fernbach-Flarsheim, the teens used the I Ching to program a piece called <em><em>Conceptual Typewriter.</em></em> A visitor could select one of several buttons, such as “the silent” (represented by a circle) or “the providing” (illustrated by sheaves of wheat), and then use a light pen to alter the image. Both artists provided the initial ideas, but the RESISTORS executed them.</p><p>Nelson, working with programmer Ned Woodman, contributed a piece titled <em><em>Labyrinth</em></em>. Running on a PDP-8 that DEC provided, <em><em>Labyrinth</em></em> was explained as “the first public demonstration of a hypertext system.” To use it, a visitor would sit at a terminal and begin reading the displayed text. For the passage “The exhibition you are attending is called <em><em>Software</em></em>.

Ghost, a company which originated at the <a href=""https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania</a>, specializes in exceptionally rugged quadrupeds, and while many of its customers use its robots for public safety and disaster relief, it also <a href=""https://www.army.mil/article/274841/promising_experiment_signals_future_integration_of_advanced_tech_into_army_units"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">provides robots</a> to the United States military, which has very specific needs when it comes to keeping humans out of danger.</p><p>In that context, it’s not unreasonable to assume that Ghost’s robots may sometimes be used to carry weapons, and despite the <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-killer-drones"" target=""_self"">proliferation of robots</a> in many roles in the Ukraine war, the idea of a legged robot carrying a weapon is not a comfortable one for many people. <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> spoke with Ghost co-founder and current CEO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavin-kenneally-321a3833/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Gavin Kenneally</a> to learn more about the new arm, and to get his perspective on selling robots to the military.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Green military robot dog opens a wooden door with articulated arm."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""a501b"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/green-military-robot-dog-opens-a-wooden-door-with-articulated-arm.jpg?id=62304622&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">The Vision 60’s new arm  has six degrees of freedom. </small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">Ghost Robotics</small></p><h2>Robots for the Military</h2><p>Ghost Robotics initially made a name for itself with its very impressive <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-minitaur-quadruped"" target=""_self"">early work with the Minitaur direct-drive quadruped</a> in 2016. The company also made headlines in late 2021, when a now-deleted post on Twitter (now X) went viral because it included a photograph of one of Ghost’s Vision 60 quadrupeds <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-armed-military-robots"" target=""_self"">with a rifle mounted on its back</a>.</p><p>That picture resulted in a <a href=""https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/news/koditscheks-letter-to-ghosts-ceo/"" target=""_blank"">very strong reaction</a>, although as <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> reported at the time, robots with guns affixed to them wasn’t new: To mention one early example, the U.S. military had already deployed weapons on mobile robots <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2008/04/armed-robots-st/"" target=""_blank"">in Iraq in 2007</a>. And while several legged robot companies <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/robots-with-weapons-industry-initiative"" target=""_self"">pledged in 2022 not to weaponize their general purpose robots</a>, the Chinese military <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/may/30/chinese-armys-latest-weapon-gun-toting-dog"" target=""_blank"">in 2024 displayed</a> quadrupeds from Unitree equipped with guns. (Unitree, based in China, was one of the signers of the 2022 pledge.)</p><p>The issue of weaponized robots goes far beyond Ghost Robotics, and far beyond robots with legs. We’ve covered both the <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/we-should-not-ban-killer-robots"" target=""_self"">practical</a> and <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-path-towards-reasonable-autonomous-weapons-regulation"" target=""_self"">ethical</a> perspectives on this extensively at <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>, and the intensity of the debates show that there is no easy answer. But to summarize one important point made by some ethicists, some military experts, and Ghost Robotics itself: robots are replaceable, humans are not. “Customers use our robots to keep people out of harm’s way,” Ghost CEO Kenneally tells <em><em>Spectrum.</em></em></p><p>It’s also worth pointing out that even the companies who signed the pledge not to weaponize their general purpose robots <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/robots-with-weapons-industry-initiative"" target=""_self"">acknowledge</a> that military robots exist, and are accepting of that, provided that such robots are used under existing legal doctrines and operate within those safeguards—and that what constraints should or should not be imposed on these kinds of robots is best decided by policymakers rather than industry.</p><p>This is essentially Ghost Robotics’ position as well, says Kenneally. “We sell our robots to U.S. and allied governments, and as part of that, the robots are used in defense applications where they will sometimes be weaponized. What’s most critical to us is that the decisions about how to use these robots are happening systematically and ethically at the government policy level.”</p><p>To some extent, these decisions are already being made within the U.S. government. <a href=""https://media.defense.gov/2023/Jan/25/2003149928/-1/-1/0/DOD-DIRECTIVE-3000.09-AUTONOMY-IN-WEAPON-SYSTEMS.PDF"" target=""_blank"">Department of Defense Directive 3000.09</a>, ‘Autonomy in Weapon Systems,’ lays out the responsibilities and limitations for how autonomous or human-directed robotics weapons systems should be developed and deployed, including requirements for human use-of-force judgements. At least in the U.S., this directive implies that there are rules and accountability for robotic weapons.</p><p></p><h2>Vision 60’s Versatile Arm Capabilities</h2><p>Ghost sees its Vision 60 quadruped as a system that its trusted customers can use as they see fit, and the manipulator enables many additional capabilities. “The primary purpose of the robot has been as a sensor platform,” Kenneally says, “but sometimes there are doors in the way, or objects that need to be moved, or you might want the robot to take a sample. So the ability to do all of that mobile manipulation has been hugely valuable for our customers.”</p><p>As it turns out, arms are good for more than manipulation. “One thing that’s been very interesting is that our customers have been using the arm as a sensor boom, which is something that we hadn’t anticipated,” says Kenneally. Ghost’s robot has plenty of cameras, but they’re mostly at the viewpoint of a moderately-sized dog. The new arm offers a more human-like vantage and a way to peek around corners or over things without exposing the whole robot.</p><p>Ghost was not particularly interested in building their own arm, and tried off-the-shelf options to get the manipulation bit working. And they did get the manipulation working; what didn’t work were any of those arms after the 50 kilogram robot rolled over on them. “We wanted to make sure that we could build an arm that could stand up to the same intense rigors of our customers’ operations that the rest of the robot can,” says Kenneally. “Morphologically, we actually consider the arm to be a fifth leg, so that the robot operates as a unified system for whole-body control.”</p><p>The rest of the robot is exceptionally rugged, which is what makes it appealing to customers with unique needs, like special forces teams. Enough battery life for more than three hours of walking (or more than 20 hours on standby) isn’t bad, and the Vision 60 is sealed against sand and dust, and can survive complete submergence in shallow water. It can operate in extreme temperatures ranging from -40 °C to 55 °C, which has been a particular challenge for robots. And if you do manage to put it in a situation where it physically breaks one of its legs, it’s easy to swap in a spare in just a few minutes, even out in the field.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Robotic dog opening a glass door with its arm in front of a building."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""724f7"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/robotic-dog-opening-a-glass-door-with-its-arm-in-front-of-a-building.jpg?id=62304623&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">The Vision 60 can open doors withe high-level direction from a human operator.</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">Ghost Robotics</small></p><h2>Quadruped Robot Competition From China</h2><p>Despite Ghost quietly selling over a thousand quadrupeds to date, Kenneally is cautious about the near future for legged robots, as is anyone who has seriously considered buying one, because it’s impossible to ignore the option of just buying one from a Chinese company at about a tenth the cost of a quadruped from a company based in the U.S. or Europe.</p><p>“China has identified legged robotics as a lynchpin technology that they are strategically funding,” Kenneally says. “I think it’s an extremely serious threat in the long term, and we have to take these competitors very seriously despite their current shortcomings.” There is a technological moat, for now, but if the market for legged robots follows the same trajectory as the market for drones did, that moat will shrink drastically over the next few years.</p><p>The United States is poised to <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/us/chinese-dronemaker-dji-urges-us-complete-security-review-2025-12-04/"" target=""_blank"">ban consumer drone sales from Chinese manufacturer DJI</a>, and <a href=""https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2017/08/us-army-just-ordered-soldiers-stop-using-drones-chinas-dji/139999/"" target=""_blank"">banned DJI drone use by federal agencies in 2017</a>. But it may be too late in some sense, as DJI’s global market share is <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/26/1094249/china-commercial-drone-dji-security/"" target=""_blank"">something like 90 percent</a>. Meanwhile, Unitree may have already cornered <a href=""https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/quadruped-state-of-the-market-unitree"" target=""_blank"">somewhere around 70 percent</a> of the global market for quadrupeds, despite <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/unitree-robot-exploit"" target=""_self"">the recent publication of exploits</a> that allow the robots to send unauthorized data to China.</p><p>In the United States in particular, private sector robotics funding is unpredictable at the best of times, and Kenneally argues that to compete with Chinese-subsidized robot-makers American companies like Ghost who produce these robots domestically will need sustained U.S. government support, too. That doesn’t mean the government has to pick which companies will be the winners, but that it should find a way to support the U.S. robotics industry as a whole, if it still wants to have a meaningful one. “The quadruped industry isn’t a science project anymore,” says Kenneally. “It’s matured, and quadruped robots are going to become extremely important in both commercial and government applications. But it’s only through continued innovation that we’ll be able to stay ahead.”</p>",https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-quadruped-robot-arm,Evan Ackerman,"Ghost robotics,Legged robot,Quadrupedal robots,Robotics,Weaponized robots,Military robots",spectrum.ieee.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""IEEE Spectrum"",""url"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/rss/fulltext"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""media""},""raw"":{""id"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-quadruped-robot-arm""}}"

That’s a problem Peng Zou and his team at startup <a href=""https://www.powerlatticeinc.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">PowerLattice</a> say they have solved by miniaturizing and repackaging high-voltage regulators.</p><p>The company claims that its new <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/chiplet"" target=""_self"">chiplets</a> deliver up to a 50 percent reduction in power consumption and twice performance per watt by sizing down the voltage conversion process and moving it significantly closer to processors.</p><h2>Shrinking and Moving Power Delivery</h2><p>Traditional systems deliver power to AI chips by converting AC power from the grid into DC power, which then gets transformed again into low-voltage (around one volt) DC, usable by the GPU. With that voltage drop, current must increase to conserve power. </p><p>This exchange happens near the processor, but the current still travels a meaningful distance in its low-voltage state. A high current traveling any distance is bad news, because the system loses power in the form of heat proportional to the current squared. “The closer you get to the processor, the less distance that the high current has to travel, and thus we can reduce the power loss,” says <a href=""https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/people/profile/hanh-phuc-le"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Hanh-Phuc Le</a>, who researches power electronics at the University California, San Diego and has no connection to PowerLattice.</p><p>Given the ever-growing <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use"" target=""_self"">power consumption of AI data centers</a>, “this has almost become a show-stopping issue today,” PowerLattice’s Zou says.</p><p>Zou thinks he and his colleagues have found a way to avoid this huge loss of power. Instead of dropping the voltage a few centimeters away from the processor, they figured out how to do it millimeters away, within the processor’s package. PowerLattice designed tiny power delivery chiplets—shrinking inductors, voltage control circuits, and software-programmable logic into an IC about twice the size of a pencil eraser. The chiplets sit under the processor’s package substrate, to which they’re connected.</p><p>One challenge the minds at PowerLattice faced was how to make inductors smaller without altering their capabilities. Inductors temporarily store energy and then release it smoothly, helping regulators maintain steady outputs. Their physical size directly influences how much energy they can manage, so shrinking them weakens their effect.</p><p>The startup countered this issue by building their inductors from a specialized magnetic alloy that “enables us to run the inductor very efficiently at high frequency,” Zou says. “We can operate at a hundred times higher frequency than the traditional solution.” At higher operating frequencies, circuits can be designed to use an inductor with a much lower inductance, meaning the component itself can be made with less physical material. The alloy is unique because it maintains better magnetic properties than comparable materials at these high frequencies.</p><p>The resulting chiplets are less than 1/20th the area of today’s voltage regulators, Zou says. And each is only 100 micrometers thick, around the thickness of a strand of hair. Being so tiny allows the chiplets to fit as close as possible to the processor, and the space savings provide valuable real estate to other components.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""3D rendering of PowerLattice's chiplets on the underside of a processor package."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""e0195"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-rendering-of-powerlattice-s-chiplets-on-the-underside-of-a-processor-package.jpg?id=62303434&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">PowerLattice’s chiplets would sit on the underside of a GPU’s package to provide power from below.</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">PowerLattice</small></p><p>Even at their small size, the proprietary tech is “highly configurable and scalable,” Zou says. Customers can use multiple chiplets for a more comprehensive fix or fewer if their architecture doesn’t require it. “It’s one key differentiator” of PowerLattice’s solution to the voltage regulation problem, according to Zou.</p><p>Employing the chiplets can reduce 50 percent of power needs for an operator, effectively doubling performance, the company claims. But this number seems ambitious to Le. He says that 50 percent power savings “could be achievable, but that means PowerLattice has to have direct control of the load, which includes the processor as well.” The only way he sees it as realistic is if the company has the ability to <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-circuit-to-boost-battery-life"" target=""_self"">manage power supply in real time </a>depending on a processor’s workload—a technique called <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/dynamic-voltage-and-frequency-scaling"" target=""_blank"">dynamic voltage and frequency scaling</a>—which PowerLattice does not.</p><h2>Facing Competition</h2><p>Right now, PowerLattice is in the midst of reliability and validation testing before it releases its first product to customers, in about two years. But bringing the chiplets to market won’t be straightforward because PowerLattice has some big-name competition. Intel, for example, is developing a <a href=""https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/ipla/software-development-platforms/servers/platforms/intel-pentium-silver-and-intel-celeron-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/fully-integrated-voltage-regulator-fivr/"" target=""_blank"">Fully Integrated Voltage Regulator</a>, a device partially devoted to solving the same problem. </p><p>Zou doesn’t consider Intel competition because, in addition to the products differing in their approaches to the power delivery problem, he does not believe Intel will be providing its technology to its competitors. “From a market position perspective, we are quite a bit different,” Zou says.</p><p>A decade ago, PowerLattice wouldn’t have room to succeed, Le says, because companies that sold processors only ensured reliability for their chips if customers purchased their power supplies as well. “Qualcomm, for example, can sell their processor chip and the vast majority of their customers also have to buy their proprietary Qualcomm power supply management chip because otherwise they would say, ‘We don’t guarantee the reliable operation of the whole system.’”</p><p>Now, though, there may be hope. “There’s a trend of what we call chiplet implementation, so it is a <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/intels-view-of-the-chiplet-revolution"" target=""_self"">heterogeneous integration</a>,” Le says.

Indeed, the 1,500-year-old game and the latest in telecommunications always seem to find each other, starting just months after the first telegraph was built in the United States, when chess went electric.</p><h2><span>The Birth of Chess by Telegraph</span></h2><p>The Baltimore–Washington telegraph was financed in 1843 with US $30,000 (about $1.3 million today) <a href=""https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/senate-stories/morses-telegraph-in-the-capitol.htm"" target=""_blank"">appropriated by Congress</a>, with the help of Morse’s business partner, <a href=""https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1860&amp;context=mainehistoryjournal"" target=""_blank"">Francis O.J. Smith</a>, who had supported the project in 1838 while still a sitting congressman from Maine. By late 1844, a bill to extend the line to New York was in front of the U.S. House of Representatives. In at least one way, drawing the attention of legislators to the new line was relatively easy—the Washington end moved back and forth between the Capitol building and<a href=""https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/headquarters-sites.pdf"" target=""_blank""> the post office</a>, near the present-day National Portrait Gallery. If you were a lawmaker in Washington at the time, the telegraph would’ve been hard to miss.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=""rblad-ieee_in_content""></div><p>But perhaps they needed more persuading. Orrin S. Wood, a telegraph operator, thought so. On 5 December 1844, Wood wrote <a href=""https://reader.library.cornell.edu/docviewer/digital?id=ezra0002_4#page/12/mode/1up"" target=""_blank"">a letter</a> to his brother-in-law, engineer Ezra Cornell, who had worked on the line and would go on to cofound Western Union:</p><p>“We have had considerable excitement in playing chess between this place and Baltimore for the last 2 or 3 weeks.…I am inclined to think that Congress will do something for Prof Morse as very many of them appear to be very much interested with [chess].”</p><p>A week later, <a href=""https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61533/pg61533-images.html#LETTER_19"" target=""_blank"">Morse wrote</a> to George M.

The telegraph’s continued operation in both inclement weather and darkness compared favorably with <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-the-count-of-monte-cristo-can-teach-us-about-cybersecurity"" target=""_self"">optical telegraphy</a>. Such systems, popular in France, consisted of regularly spaced flag towers that relayed messages by semaphore; they were costly to build and operate and only worked in daylight and good weather.</p><p>While Morse played up people’s interest in telegraphic chess, the game itself didn’t obviously begin with promotional intent. It began with checkers. We know this because Morse’s associate Alfred Vail kept a “Journal of the Magnetic Telegraph between Washington and Baltimore” (now part of the <a href=""https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217214"" target=""_blank"">Vail Telegraph Collection</a> at the Smithsonian) in which he meticulously recorded messages sent over the wire for posterity.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""A hand-written note dated Nov 26 records chess moves in a game between Washington, D.C, and Baltimore "" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""d7781"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-hand-written-note-dated-nov-26-records-chess-moves-in-a-game-between-washington-d-c-and-baltimore.jpg?id=62293859&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">Notes from a 26 November 1844 chess game record players’ moves, as well as other snippets of information, such as “I sent tea for Mr. Vail by 5 o’clock train.”</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit""><a href=""https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217214"" target=""_blank"">Smithsonian Institution Archives</a></small></p><p>On 15 November 1844, Vail in Washington instructed Henry J. Rogers in Baltimore to “get a checkerboard and let us play a game tomorrow morning.” Vail promised to send instructions by regular mail on the five o’clock train. At first confused, Rogers came up with the idea of using numbered squares to communicate locations on the board. Later that day, Rogers announced that John Wills, a journalist with the <em><em>Baltimore Patriot</em></em>, would play in his place.</p><p>The next morning, before the checkers game began, Vail recorded a telegraphic exchange between himself and Rogers, in which Vail suggests the game is for private enjoyment, and he would prefer that Wills—a reporter—not write about it:</p><p style=""margin-left: 20px;""><em>Do you think the game any advantage R</em></p><p style=""margin-left: 20px;""><em>What game V</em></p><p style=""margin-left: 20px;""><em>Checkers R</em></p><p style=""margin-left: 20px;""><em>Amusement V</em></p><p style=""margin-left: 20px;""><em>Don’t you think people will make remarks R</em></p><p style=""margin-left: 20px;""><em>Not if it is done by ourselves V</em></p><p style=""margin-left: 20px;""><em>yes have you any objections to Wills R</em></p><p style=""margin-left: 20px;""><em>none if he does not publish it V</em></p><p style=""margin-left: 20px;""><em>yes R</em></p><p>Wills was thoroughly impressed with the technology, calling it “another wonder of the age,” according to Rogers. And so the telegraphers agreed that he could publish an account of the game, which perhaps was Vail’s hope all along. The story was still being prepared for publication on 18 November when Vail tapped, “The Washington Chess Club challenge Baltimore to a game.”</p><h2>How about a Nice Game of Chess?</h2><p>Vail’s 1845 book about the telegraph includes <a href=""https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61533/pg61533-images.html#CHESS"" target=""_blank"">a brief report</a> on chess.

While many of the rules and conventions of chess would be familiar to modern chess players, the games were unusual in other ways. At the time, the standard way of describing chess moves was descriptive notation, says <a href=""https://new.uschess.org/author/john-mccrary"" target=""_blank"">John McCrary</a>, a former president of the <a href=""https://new.uschess.org/"" target=""_blank"">United States Chess Federation</a> who maintains a collection of some 100 chess books from <a href=""https://chesscollectorsinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/rare-chess-book-collecting.pdf"" target=""_blank"">before 1900</a>. For instance, “pawn to queen’s bishop’s four” described moving a pawn in front of the bishop on the queen’s side of the board to the fourth row from the bottom.<p>Before the electrical telegraph, such descriptions would have been used in correspondence chess, played by mail. And <a href=""https://archive.org/details/TheOxfordCompanionToChessFirstEditionByDavidHooperKennethWhyld/page/n355/mode/2up"" target=""_blank""><em><em>The Oxford Companion to Chess</em></em></a> (1984) describes a proposed 1823 match between France and England that intended to use semaphore telegraph, although the notation used was either never planned or has been lost to time.</p><p>But Vail and Rogers used a system that assigned a unique number to each of the 64 squares. So “pawn to queen’s bishop’s four” would have been rendered as “11 to 27.” Though the game itself can be remarkably complex, that system allowed individual moves to be communicated simply. “The exchange of information in chess is relatively low,” says <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-kazdan-ba92968/"" target=""_blank"">David Kazdan</a>, an engineer at <a href=""https://case.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Case Western Reserve University</a> who has recently overseen a <a href=""https://www.arrl.org/news/view/using-amateur-radio-to-play-chess"" target=""_blank"">renewed collaboration</a> between the school’s radio and chess clubs. “You don’t need much of a communication channel to play chess.”</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Two hand-drawn grids labeled \u201ccheckers\u201d and \u201ccheckers &amp; chess,\u201d with numbers in different squares.

At the time, the white pieces did not always take the<a href=""https://new.uschess.org/news/evolution-modern-chess-rules-white-moves-first"" target=""_blank""> first move</a>. The sides also agreed to a limit of 10 minutes per move, even though time controls weren’t common in chess, and the chess clock had not yet been invented. And while Vail wanted “first rate players,” McCrary calls the overall play weak, with a poor understanding of the long-term planning needed to coordinate all of the pieces. Both teams also made tactical errors. For example, in the second game, Washington overlooked that one of their pawns was overworked defending two other pieces simultaneously, watched as Baltimore captured one of the pieces, and elected not to retaliate in order to continue defending a more valuable knight. “Even with changing conventions of that time, what was there in the description was atypical,” says McCrary.</p><p class=""ieee-inbody-related"">RELATED: <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/chess-computer-1920"" target=""_self"">This 1920 Chess Automaton Was Wired to Win</a></p><p>The teams took a break during the first game and then reconvened on 28 November. With a pawn in position to advance to the last row, where it would be “promoted”—that is, replaced by a more dangerous piece of the player’s choice—Baltimore swept in with its queen and readied checkmate in one move. Unable to salvage the game, Washington resigned. “Ha ha,” wrote Rogers. “Ha ha,” responded Vail.</p><p>There is no record of overall standings, and no winner was declared between the two cities after all games had been played.</p><h2>The Tech of Telegraph Chess</h2><p>By today’s standards, the hardware that relayed the moves was relatively simple, mainly consisting of a battery, a switch, and a magnet. “It’s not all that different from a doorbell,” says <a href=""https://www.albany.edu/history/faculty/david-hochfelder"" target=""_blank"">David Hochfelder</a>, a historian at the <a href=""https://www.albany.edu/"" target=""_blank"">State University of New York at Albany</a> who has studied the <a href=""https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/3173/telegraph-america-1832-1920"" target=""_blank"">early American telegraph</a>.</p><p>Laying the line between the two cities had been difficult, with costly delays after failed attempts to bury the cable and to use cheaper noninsulated wire. Eventually, overhead insulated copper wire was strung the distance between poles.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Black and white photo of a tabletop apparatus with metal gears."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""d725b"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-tabletop-apparatus-with-metal-gears.jpg?id=62293867&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">On 24 May 1844, this telegraph register received the first message sent by telegraph: “What hath God wrought.”</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">AP</small></p><p>Years before the chess match, Morse had considered a messaging system that used only numbers, which corresponded to set words or phrases listed in a code book. But he soon realized that a practical communications service would need an alphabetic component to spell out proper names.</p><p>This led to Morse’s eponymous code, which assigns a series of short and long signals to different alphanumeric characters. By tapping on a key, telegraph operators would interrupt a battery-powered current that ran the length of the telegraph wire. At the other end, an electromagnet moved a stylus, pen, or pencil, to mark a piece of paper with the corresponding dots and dashes, which an operator would then read. (The sounder, which turned the signals into audible sounds, hadn’t yet been invented.)</p><p class=""ieee-inbody-related"">Related: <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/morse-codes-vanquished-competitor-the-dial-telegraph"" target=""_self"">Morse Code’s Vanquished Competitor: The Dial Telegraph</a></p><p>During the chess games, the telegraph operators occasionally asked each other how many people were in the room. At times, a dozen kibitzers looked on. At others, only the rotating cast of chess players and telegraph operators was present.</p><h2>Telegraph Chess Moves On</h2><p>The Baltimore–Washington telegraph line was an immediate hit with a general public that embraced popular science through lectures and popular books and magazines. <em><em>Scientific American</em></em> was founded in 1845, for example. But people were more curious to see the telegraph at work than they were to use its services, even though the line operated <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/first-week-of-the-telegraph/"" target=""_blank"">free of charge</a> for the first year. “Operators tended to show its capabilities rather than handling actual message traffic,” says Hochfelder.</p><p>The lack of activity is sometimes evident in the telegraph journal. Many of the messages are purely functional (“I am ready,” “stop 30 minutes”); simple greetings; notifications of letters sent and received; or requests for daily newspapers. The Baltimore end of the telegraph was in the Mt. Clare station of the <a href=""https://preservationmaryland.org/this-day-in-history-chartering-of-the-bo-railroad/"" target=""_blank"">B&amp;O railroad</a>, and the telegraph line ran alongside the tracks. Mail delivered by train took half a day door to door, says Hochfelder, and the telegraph offered little practical advantage.</p><p>On 5 December 1844, Rogers wrote to Vail:</p><p>“I hear from several sources that we are making rather an unfavorable impression with the religious part of the community, and I am under the impression if we continue after the present party is through that we will be injured more than any benefit might or can be derived from it.”</p><p>The exact nature of the religious community’s complaint with telegraph chess is unclear.</p><p>Although Morse wrote to Vail on the day of the first chess game that he “was much pleased with your game of drafts,” he came to feel that chess was too <a href=""https://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1926CableChess/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">frivolous</a> for the telegraph, as noted by the chess writer Tim Harding in his <a href=""https://mcfarlandbooks.com/product/correspondence-chess-in-britain-and-ireland-1824-1987/"" target=""_blank""><em><em>Correspondence Chess in Britain and Ireland, 1824–1987</em></em></a> (McFarland, 2011)<em><em>.</em></em> Whatever the reasons, it appears that after 17 December 1844, no more chess was played on the line. And in the end, Congress didn’t fund a telegraphic connection to New York, nor did it acquire perpetual rights to the telegraph, in part because Morse’s business partner had other designs, says Hochfelder. The Baltimore–Washington line operated under the auspices of the <a href=""https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/telegraph.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Postal Service</a> from 1845 to 1847, when funding ended.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Two black and white photos.

Over the next few years, companies built local lines and networks to connect cities across the country. Most notably, Ezra Cornell’s Western Union completed a <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-transcontinental-telegraph.htm"" target=""_blank"">transcontinental telegraph in 1861</a>, and eventually became a monopoly in the United States. Ordinary people rarely used the telegraph, says Hochfelder, but it transformed industries such as finance and journalism.</p><p>Meanwhile, telegraph chess was taken up elsewhere. In 1845, for example, a match between London and Gosport, England, involved inventor <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/morse-codes-vanquished-competitor-the-dial-telegraph"" target=""_self"">Charles Wheatstone</a> and chess master Howard Staunton. But it would take another few decades for telechess to become more widespread, with prominent club matches <a href=""https://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1926CableChess/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">played over telegraph</a> from the 1890s into the 1920s.</p><p>High-level chess competitions tend to be held in person, but games have been played remotely from time to time. For example, in 1965, U.S. grandmaster Bobby Fischer relayed his moves <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0UJ52Gw5W4"" target=""_blank"">by teletype</a> over telephone lines from New York City to Havana, after the U.S. State Department prevented his attending a tournament there.

Such innovation involves some risk, because an intervention anywhere on the U.K.’s tightly meshed power system can have system-wide impacts. (Grid operators elsewhere are choosing to start with GETs at their systems’ periphery—where there’s less impact if something goes wrong.)</p><p>The question is how far—and how fast—the U.K.’s grid operators can push GETs capabilities. The new technologies still have a limited track record, so operators are cautiously feeling their way toward heavier investment. Power system experts also have unanswered questions about these advanced grid capabilities. For example, will they create more complexity than grid operators can manage in real time? Might feedback between different devices destabilize the grid?</p><p>There is no consensus yet as to how to even screen for such risks, let alone protect against them, says <a href=""https://www.robinpreece.com/"" target=""_blank"">Robin Preece</a>, professor in future power systems at the University of Manchester, in England. “We’re at the start of establishing that now, but we’re building at the same time. So it’s kind of this race between the necessity to get this technology installed as quickly as possible, and our ability to fully understand what’s happening.”</p><h2>How is the U.K. Managing Grid Congestion?</h2><p>One of the most innovative and high-stakes tricks in the U.K.’s toolbox employs electronic power-flow controllers, devices that shift electricity from jammed circuits to those with spare capacity. These devices have been able to finesse enough additional wind power through grid bottlenecks to replace an entire gas-fired generator. Installed in northern England four years ago by <a href=""https://www.smartwires.com/"" target=""_blank"">Smart Wires</a>, based in Durham, N.C., these SmartValves are expected to help even more as NESO installs more of them and masters their capabilities.</p><p>Warwick-based <a href=""https://www.nationalgrid.com/electricity-transmission"" target=""_blank"">National Grid Electricity Transmission</a>, the grid operator for England and Wales, is adding SmartValves and also replacing several thousand kilometers of overhead wire with advanced conductors that can carry more current. And it’s using a technique called <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/dynamic-line-rating-grid-congestion"" target=""_self"">dynamic line rating</a>, whereby sensors and models work together to predict when weather conditions will allow lines to carry extra current.</p><p>Other kinds of GETs are also being used globally. Advanced conductors are the most widely deployed. Dynamic line rating is increasingly common in European countries, and U.S. utilities are beginning to take it seriously. Europe also leads the world in topology-optimization software, which reconfigures power routes to alleviate congestion, and advanced power-flow-control devices like SmartValves.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Workers wearing hard hats and safety harnesses standing high up on an electricity pylon in the countryside"" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""4a9a9"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-wearing-hard-hats-and-safety-harnesses-standing-high-up-on-an-electricity-pylon-in-the-countryside.jpg?id=62286977&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">Engineers install dynamic line rating technology from the Boston-based company LineVision on National Grid’s transmission network. </small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">National Grid Electricity Transmission </small></p><p>SmartValves’ chops stand out at the Penwortham substation in Lancashire, England, one of two National Grid sites where the device made its U.K. debut in 2021. Penwortham substation is a major transmission hub, whose spokes desperately need congestion relief. Auditory evidence of heavy power flows was clear during my visit to the substation, which buzzes loudly. The sound is due to the electromechanical stresses on the substation’s massive transformers, explains my guide, National Grid commissioned engineer Paul Lloyd.</p><p>Penwortham’s transformers, circuits, and protective relays are spread over 15 hectares, sandwiched between pastureland and suburban homes near Preston, a small city north of Manchester. Power arrives from the north on two pairs of 400-kilovolt AC lines, and most of it exits southward via 400-kV and 275-kV double-circuit wires.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Power lines crossing a rural pasture, with an old fence in the foreground and a substation in the background."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""ce7e1"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/power-lines-crossing-a-rural-pasture-with-an-old-fence-in-the-foreground-and-a-substation-in-the-background.jpg?id=62286959&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">Transmission lines lead to the congested Penwortham substation, which has become a test-bed for GETs such as  SmartValves and dynamic line rating. </small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">Peter Fairley </small></p><p>What makes the substation a strategic test-bed for GETs is its position just north of the U.K. grid’s biggest bottleneck, known as Boundary B7a, which runs east to west across the island. Nine circuits traverse the B7a: the four AC lines headed south from Penwortham, four AC lines closer to Yorkshire’s North Sea coast, and a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) link offshore. In theory, those circuits can collectively carry 13.6 gigawatts across the B7a. But NESO caps its flow at several gigawatts lower to ensure that no circuits overload if any two lines turn off.</p><p>Such limits are necessary for grid reliability, but they are leaving terawatt-hours of wind power stranded in Scotland and increasing consumers’ energy costs: an extra £196 million (US $265 million) in 2024 alone. The costs stem from NESO having to ramp up gas-fired generators to meet demand down south while simultaneously compensating wind-farm operators for curtailing their output, as required under U.K. policy.</p><p>So National Grid keeps tweaking Penwortham. In 2011 the substation got its first big GET: phase-shifting transformers (PSTs), a type of analog flow controller. PSTs adjust power flow by creating an AC waveform whose alternating voltage leads or lags its alternating current. They do so by each PST using a pair of connected transformers to selectively combine power from an AC transmission circuit’s three phases. Motors reposition electrical connections on the transformer coils to adjust flows.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Large machines outdoors connected to power lines "" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""d09c1"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/large-machines-outdoors-connected-to-power-lines.jpg?id=62286963&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">Phase-shifting transformers (PSTs) were installed in 2012 at the Penwortham substation and are the analog predecessor to SmartValves. They’re powerful but also bulky and relatively inflexible. It can take 10 minutes or more for the PST’s motorized actuators at Penwortham to tap their full range of flow control, whereas SmartValves can shift within milliseconds.</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">National Grid Electricity Transmission </small></p><p><span>Penwortham’s pair of 540-tonne PSTs occupy the entire south end of the substation, along with their dedicated chillers, relays, and power supplies. Delivering all that hardware required extensive road closures and floating a huge barge up the adjacent River Ribble, an event that made national news.</span></p><p>The SmartValves at Penwortham stand in stark contrast to the PSTs’ heft, complexity, and mechanics. SmartValves are a type of static synchronous series compensator, or SSSC—a solid-state alternative to PSTs that employs power electronics to tweak power flows in milliseconds. I saw two sets of them tucked into a corner of the substation, occupying a quarter of the area of the PSTs.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Workers on an elevated platform and tall, cylindrical machinery"" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""146f3"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-on-an-elevated-platform-and-tall-cylindrical-machinery.jpg?id=62286971&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">The SmartValve V103 design [above] experienced some teething and reliability issues that were ironed out with the technology’s next iteration, the V104.</small> <small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">            National Grid Electricity Transmission/Smart Wires        </small> </p><p>The SmartValves are first and foremost an insurance policy to guard against a potentially crippling event: the sudden loss of one of the B7a’s 400-kV lines. If that were to happen, gigawatts of power would instantly seek another route over neighboring lines. And if it happened on a windy day, when lots of power is streaming in from the north, the resulting surge could overload the 275-kV circuits headed from Penwortham to Liverpool. The SmartValves’ job is to save the day.</p><p>They do this by adding impedance to the 275-kV lines, thus acting to divert more power to the remaining 400-kV lines. This rerouting of power prevents a blackout that could potentially cascade through the grid. The upside to that protection is that NESO can safely schedule an additional 350 MW over the B7a.</p><p>The savings add up. “That’s 350 MW of wind you’re no longer curtailing from wind farms. So that’s 350 times £100 a megawatt-hour,” says Leslie, at NESO. “That’s also 350 MW of gas-fired power that you don’t need to replace the wind. So that’s 350 times £120 a megawatt-hour. The numbers get big quickly.”</p><p><a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266637500"" target=""_blank"">Mark Osborne</a>, the National Grid lead asset life-cycle engineer managing its SmartValve projects, estimates the devices are saving U.K. customers over £100 million (US $132 million) a year. At that rate, they’ll pay for themselves “within a few years,” Osborne says. By utility standards, where investments are normally amortized over decades, that’s “almost immediately,” he adds.</p><h2>How Do Grid-Enhancing Technologies Work?</h2><p>The way Smart Wires’ SSSC devices adjust power flow is based on emulating impedance, which is a strange beast created by AC power. An AC flow’s changing magnetic field induces an additional voltage in the line’s conductor, which then acts as a drag on the initial field. Smart Wires’ SSSC devices alter power flow by emulating that natural process, effectively adding or subtracting impedance by adding their own voltage wave to the line. Adding a wave that leads the original voltage wave will boost flow, while adding a lagging wave will reduce flow.</p><p>The SSSC’s submodules of capacitors and high-speed insulated-gate bipolar transistors operate in sequence to absorb power from a line and synthesize its novel impedance-altering waves. And thanks to its digital controls and switches, the device can within milliseconds flip from maximum power push to maximum pull.</p><p>You can trace the development of SSSCs to the advent of HVDC transmission in the 1950s. HVDC converters take power from an AC grid and efficiently convert it and transfer it over a DC line to another point in the same grid, or to a neighboring AC grid. In 1985, Narain Hingorani, an HVDC expert at the Palo Alto–based Electric Power Research Institute, showed that similar converters could modulate the flow of an AC line. Four years later, Westinghouse engineer Laszlo Gyugyi proposed SSSCs, which became the basis for Smart Wires’ boxes.</p><p>Major power-equipment manufacturers tried to commercialize SSSCs in the early 2000s. But utilities had little need for flow control back then because they had plenty of conventional power plants that could meet local demand when transmission lines were full.</p><p>The picture changed as solar and wind generation exploded and conventional plants began shutting down. In years past, grid operators addressed grid congestion by turning power plants on or off in strategic locations. But as of 2024, the U.K. had shut down all of its coal-fired power plants—save one, which now burns wood—and it has vowed to slash gas-fired generation from about a quarter of electricity supply in 2024 to at most 5 percent in 2030.</p><p class=""pull-quote"">The U.K.’s extreme grid challenge has made it ground zero for some of the boldest GETs testing and deployment.</p><p>To seize the emerging market opportunity presented by changing grid operations, Smart Wires had to make a crucial technology upgrade: ditching transformers. The company’s first SSSC, and those from other suppliers, relied on a transformer to absorb lightning, voltage surges, and every other grid assault that could fry their power electronics. This made them bulky and added cost. So Smart Wires engineers set to work in 2017 to see if they could live without the transformer, says Frank Kreikebaum, Smart Wires’s interim chief of engineering. Two years later the company had assembled a transformerless electronic shield. It consisted of a suite of filters and diverters, along with a control system to activate them. Ditching the transformer produced a trim, standardized product—a modular system-in-a-box.</p><p>SmartValves work at any voltage and are generally ganged together to achieve a desired level of flow control. They can be delivered fast, and they fit in the kinds of tight spaces that are common in substations. “It’s not about cost, even though we’re competitive there. It’s about ‘how quick’ and ‘can it fit,’” says Kreikebaum.</p><p>And if the grid’s pinch point shifts? The devices can be quickly moved to another substation. “It’s a Lego-brick build,” says <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/owen-wilkes/?originalSubdomain=uk"" target=""_blank"">Owen Wilkes</a>, National Grid’s director of network design. Wilkes’s team decides where to add equipment based on today’s best projections, but he appreciates the flexibility to respond to unexpected changes.</p><p>National Grid’s deployments in 2021 were the highest-voltage installation of SSSCs at the time, and success there is fueling expansion. National Grid now has packs of SmartValves installed at three substations in northern England and under construction at another, with five more installations planned in that area. Smart Wires has also commissioned commercial projects at transmission substations in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, and the United States.</p><h2>Dynamic Line Rating Boosts Grid Efficiency</h2><p>In addition to SSSCs, National Grid has deployed lidar that senses sag on Penwortham’s 275-kV lines—an indication that they’re starting to overheat. The sensors are part of a dynamic line rating system and help grid operators maximize the amount of current that high-voltage lines can carry based on near-real-time weather conditions. (Cooler weather means more capacity.) Now the same technology is being deployed across the B7a—a £1 million investment that is projected to save consumers £33 million annually, says <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/corin-ireland-4040b2179/?originalSubdomain=uk"" target=""_blank"">Corin Ireland</a>, a National Grid optimization engineer with the task of seizing GETs opportunities.</p><p>There’s also a lot of old conductor wires being swapped out for those that can carry more power.

That’s partly due to the conservative nature of power utilities, and partly because grid operators already have plenty to keep their eyes on. It also stems from the unknowns that still surround GETs, like whether they might take the grid in unforeseen directions if allowed to respond automatically, or get stuck in a feedback loop responding to each other. Imagine SmartValve controllers at different substations fighting, with one substation jumping to remove impedance that the other just added, causing fluctuating power flows.</p><p>“These technologies operate very quickly, but the computers in the control room are still very reliant on people making decisions,” says Ireland. “So there are time scales that we have to take into consideration when planning and operating the network.”</p><p>This kind of conservative dispatching leaves value on the table. For example, the dynamic line rating models can spit out new line ratings every 15 minutes, but grid operators get updates only every 24 hours. Fewer updates means fewer opportunities to tap the system’s ability to boost capacity. Similarly, for SmartValves, NESO activates installations at only one substation at a time. And control-room operators turn them on manually, even though the devices could automatically respond to faults within milliseconds.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Workers in harnesses and hard hats climbing and standing high up on a transmission tower in the countryside."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""9e46e"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-in-harnesses-and-hard-hats-climbing-and-standing-high-up-on-a-transmission-tower-in-the-countryside.jpg?id=62286819&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">National Grid is upgrading transmission lines dating as far back as the 1960s.

For example, when Penwortham is adding impedance to push megawatts off the 275-kV lines, a set closer to Scotland could simultaneously pull the power north, nudging the sum over to the B7a’s eastern circuits. Simulations by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hiorns-6a92b158/?originalSubdomain=uk"" target=""_blank"">Andy Hiorns</a>, a former National Grid planning director who consults for Smart Wires, suggest that this kind of cooperative action should increase the B7a circuits’ usable capacity by another 250 to 300 MW. “You double the effectiveness by using them as pairs,” he says.</p><p>Operating multiple flow controllers may become necessary for unlocking the next boundary en route to London, south of the B7a, called Boundary B8. As dynamic line rating, beefier conductors, and SmartValves send more power across the B7a, lines traversing B8 are reaching their limits. Eventually, every boundary along the route will have to be upgraded.</p><p>Meanwhile, back at its U.S. headquarters, Smart Wires is developing other applications for its SSSCs, such as filtering out power oscillations that can destabilize grids and reduce allowable transfers.

In general, a VPP pulls together many small components—like rooftop solar, home batteries, and smart thermostats—into a single coordinated power system. The system responds to grid needs on demand, whether by making stored energy available or reducing energy consumption by smart devices during peak hours.</p><p>VPPs <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/virtual-power-plants-real-power"" target=""_self"">had a moment</a> in the mid-2010s, but market conditions and the technology weren’t quite aligned for them to take off. Electricity demand <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65264"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">wasn’t high enough</a>, and existing sources—coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables—met demand and kept prices stable. Additionally, despite the costs of hardware like solar panels and batteries falling, the software to link and manage these resources lagged behind, and there wasn’t much financial incentive for it to catch up. </p><p>But times have changed, and less than a decade later, the stars are aligning in VPPs’ favor. They’re hitting a deployment inflection point, and they could play a significant role in meeting energy demand over the next 5 to 10 years in a way that’s faster, cheaper, and greener than other solutions. </p><h2>U.S. Electricity Demand Is Growing</h2><p>Electricity demand in the United States is expected to <a href=""https://www.icf.com/insights/energy/electricity-demand-expected-to-grow"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">grow 25 percent</a> by 2030 due to data center buildouts, electric vehicles, manufacturing, and electrification, according to estimates from technology consultant ICF International.</p><p>At the same time, a host of bottlenecks are making it hard to expand the grid.

There are more distributed energy resources available than there were before, and the last decade has seen advances in grid management using autonomous controls.</p><p>At the heart of it all, though, is the technology that stores and dispatches electricity on demand: batteries. </p><h2>Advances in Battery Technology</h2><p>Over the last 10 years, battery prices have plummeted: the average <a href=""https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">lithium-ion battery pack</a><a href=""https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> price</a> fell from US $715 per kilowatt-hour in 2014 to $115 per kWh in 2024. Their <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1234-april-18-2022-volumetric-energy-density-lithium-ion-batteries"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">energy density</a> has simultaneously increased thanks to a combination of materials advancements, design optimization of battery cells, and improvements in the packaging of battery systems, says <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-gross-b4a86714/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Oliver Gross</a>, a senior fellow in energy storage and electrification at automaker Stellantis.</p><p>The biggest improvements have come in batteries’ cathodes and electrolytes, with nickel-based cathodes starting to be used about a decade ago. “In many ways, the cathode limits the capacity of the battery, so by unlocking higher capacity cathode materials, we have been able to take advantage of the intrinsic higher capacity of anode materials,” says <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregless/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Greg Less</a>, the director of the University of Michigan’s Battery Lab.</p><p>Increasing the percentage of nickel in the cathode (relative to other metals) increases energy density because nickel can hold more lithium per gram than materials like cobalt or manganese, exchanging more electrons and participating more fully in the redox reactions that move lithium in and out of the battery. The same goes for silicon, which has become more common in anodes. However, there’s a trade-off: These materials cause more structural instability during the battery’s cycling.</p><p>The anode and cathode are surrounded by a liquid electrolyte. The electrolyte has to be electrically and chemically stable when exposed to the anode and cathode in order to avoid safety hazards like thermal runaway or fires and rapid degradation. “The real revolution has been the breakthroughs in chemistry to make the electrolyte stable against more reactive cathode materials to get the energy density up,” says Gross. Chemical compound additives—many of them based on sulfur and boron chemistry—for the electrolyte help create stable layers between it and the anode and cathode materials. “They form these protective layers very early in the manufacturing process so that the cell stays stable throughout its life.”</p><p>These advances have primarily been made on electric vehicle batteries, which differ from grid-scale batteries in that EVs are often parked or idle, while grid batteries are constantly connected and need to be ready to transfer energy. However, Gross says, “the same approaches that got our energy density higher in EVs can also be applied to optimizing grid storage. The materials might be a little different, but the methodologies are the same.” The most popular cathode material for grid storage batteries at the moment is lithium iron phosphate, or LFP.</p><p>Thanks to these technical gains and dropping costs, a domino effect has been set in motion: The more batteries deployed, the cheaper they become, which fuels more deployment and creates positive feedback loops.</p><p>Regions that have experienced frequent blackouts—like parts of <a href=""https://www.texastribune.org/2024/07/18/texas-energy-grid-power-outages-climate-change-infrastructure/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Texas</a>, <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-11-06/edison-blacks-out-more-customers-to-stop-utility-sparked-fires"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">California</a>, and <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/puerto-rico-earthquake-power-outages-prepa-news"" target=""_self"">Puerto Rico</a>—are a prime market for home batteries. Texas-based <a href=""https://www.basepowercompany.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Base Power</a>, which raised $1 billion in Series C funding in October, installs batteries at customers’ homes and becomes their retail power provider, charging the batteries when excess wind or solar production makes prices cheap, and then selling that energy back to the grid when demand spikes.</p><p>There is, however, still room for improvement. For wider adoption, says Nasiri, “the installed battery cost needs to get under $100 per kWh for large VPP deployments.”</p><h2>Improvements in VPP Software</h2><p>The software infrastructure that once limited VPPs to pilot projects has matured into a robust digital backbone, making it feasible to operate VPPs at grid scale. Advances in AI are key: Many VPPs now use machine learning algorithms to predict load flexibility, solar and battery output, customer behavior, and grid stress events. This improves the dependability of a VPP’s capacity, which was historically a major concern for grid operators.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25"" style=""float: left;""> <img alt=""Close-up of a roof-top solar panel."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""b3240"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-a-roof-top-solar-panel.jpg?id=62288941&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">While solar panels have advanced, VPPs have been held back by a lack of similar advancement in the needed software until recently.</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">Sunrun</small></p><p>Cybersecurity and interoperability standards are still evolving. Interconnection processes and data visibility in many areas aren’t consistent, making it hard to monitor and coordinate distributed resources effectively. In short, while the technology and economics for VPPs are firmly in place, there’s work yet to be done aligning regulation, infrastructure, and market design.</p><p>On top of technical and cost constraints, VPPs have long been held back by regulations that prevented them from participating in energy markets like traditional generators.

Similarly, Sunrun’s Northern California VPP delivered 535 megawatts of power from home-based batteries to the grid in July, and saw a <a href=""https://www.utilitydive.com/news/sunrun-sees-400-growth-in-virtual-power-plant-participation/805169/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">400 percent increase</a> in VPP participation from last year.</p><p><a href=""https://www.ferc.gov/ferc-order-no-2222-explainer-facilitating-participation-electricity-markets-distributed-energy"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">FERC Order 2222</a>, issued in 2020, requires regional grid operators to allow VPPs to sell power, reduce load, or provide grid services directly to wholesale market operators, and get paid the same market price as a traditional power plant for those services. However, many states and grid regions don’t yet have a process in place to comply with the FERC order. And because utilities profit from grid expansion and not VPP deployment, they’re not incentivized to integrate VPPs into their operations. Utilities “view customer batteries as competition,” says Heavner.</p><p>According to Nasiri, VPPs would have a meaningful impact on the grid if they achieve a penetration of 2 percent of the market’s peak power. “Larger penetration of up to 5 percent for up to 4 hours is required to have a meaningful capacity impact for grid planning and operation,” he says.</p><p>In other words, VPP operators have their work cut out for them in continuing to unlock the flexible capacity in homes, businesses, and EVs. Additional technical and policy advances could move VPPs from a niche reliability tool to a key power source and grid stabilizer for the energy tumult ahead.<a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_2"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""></a></p>",https://spectrum.ieee.org/virtual-power-plants-battery-tech,Vanessa Bates Ramirez,"Virtual power plant,Batteries,Software,Solar panels",spectrum.ieee.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""IEEE Spectrum"",""url"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/rss/fulltext"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""media""},""raw"":{""id"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/virtual-power-plants-battery-tech""}}"

Dexcom claimed the G7 to be the <a href=""https://investors.dexcom.com/news/news-details/2022/Dexcom-G7-Receives-FDA-Clearance-The-Most-Accurate-Continuous-Glucose-Monitoring-System-Cleared-in-the-U.S/default.aspx"" target=""_blank"">“most accurate sensor”</a> available to the thousands of people with Type 1 diabetes who use continuous glucose monitors to help manage their blood sugars. But Heller found that its real-world performance wasn’t up to par. In a September 2023 post on his Substack, which is dedicated to covering Type 1 diabetes research and management, he <a href=""https://open.substack.com/pub/danheller/p/the-dexcom-g7-vs-g6-which-is-better?r=1q2796&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">wrote about the experience</a> and predicted an increase in adverse events with the G7, drawing on his past experience leading tech and biotech companies. <strong></strong></p><p>In the two years since Heller’s experiment, many other users have reported issues with the device. Some complaints regard failed connection and deployment issues, which Dexcom claims to have <a href=""https://www.medtechdive.com/news/dexcom-execs-fixed-g7-quality-problems/804383/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">now addressed</a>. More concerning are reports of erratic, inaccurate readings. A <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/1539517486772872"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">public Facebook group</a> dedicated to sharing negative experiences with the G7 has grown to thousands of users, and several class action <a href=""https://rosenlegal.com/case/dexcom-inc/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">lawsuits</a> have been filed against the company, alleging <a href=""https://wilshirelawfirm.com/dexcom-class-action-lawsuit/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">false advertising</a> and <a href=""https://cowperlaw.com/cowper-law-llp-dicello-levitt-file-class-action-against-dexcom-over-misleading-claims-about-g7-cgm/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">misleading claims</a> about device accuracy. </p><p>Yet, based on a standard metric in the industry, the G7 is one of the most accurate glucose sensors available. “Accuracy in the performance of our device is our number one priority. We understand this is a lifesaving device for people with Type 1 diabetes,” <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-c-simpson-533a083/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Peter Simpson</a>, Dexcom’s senior vice president of innovation and sensor technology, told <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>. Simpson acknowledged some variability in individual sensors, but stood by the accuracy of the devices.</p><p>So why have users faced issues? In part, metrics used in marketing can be misleading compared to real world performance. Differences in study design, combined with complex biological realities, mean that the accuracy of these biosensors can’t be boiled down to one number—and users are learning this the hard way. </p><h2>Dexcom’s Glucose Monitors</h2><p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) typically consist of a small filament inserted under the skin, a transmitter, and a receiver. The filament is coated with an enzyme that generates an electrical signal when it reacts with glucose in the fluid surrounding the body’s cells. That signal is then converted to a digital signal and processed to generate glucose readings every few minutes. Each sensor lasts a week or two before needing to be replaced. <strong></strong></p><p>The technology has come a long way in recent years. In the 2010s, these devices required blood glucose calibrations twice a day and still weren’t reliable enough to dose insulin based on the readings. Now, some insulin pumps use the near-real-time data to <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/artificial-pancreas-could-conquer-diabetes"" target=""_blank"">automatically make adjustments</a>. With those improvements has come greater trust in the data users receive—and higher standards. A faulty reading could result in a dangerous dose of insulin. </p><p>The G7 introduced several changes to Dexcom’s earlier designs, including a much smaller footprint, and updated the algorithm used to translate sensor signals into glucose readings for better accuracy, Simpson says. “From a performance perspective, we did demonstrate in a clinical trial that the G7 is significantly more accurate than the G6,” he says. </p><p>So Heller and others were surprised when the new Dexcom sensor seemed to be performing worse. For some batches of sensors, it’s possible that the issue was in part due to an unvalidated change in a component used in a resistive layer of the sensors. The new component showed worse performance, according to a <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/dexcom-inc-700835-03042025"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">warning letter</a> issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2025, following an audit of two U.S. manufacturing sites. The material has since been removed from all G7 sensors, Simpson says, and the company is continuing to work with the FDA to address concerns. (“The warning letter does not restrict Dexcom’s ability to produce, market, manufacture or distribute products, require recall of any products, nor restrict our ability to seek clearance of new products,” Dexcom added in a statement.)</p><p>“<span>There is a distribution of accuracies that have to do with people’s physiology and also the devices themselves. Even in our clinical studies, we saw some that were really precise and some that had a little bit of inaccuracy to them,” says Simpson. “But in general, our sensor is very accurate.”</span></p><p><span>In late November Abbott—one of Dexcom’s main competitors—<a href=""https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-recalls-and-early-alerts/early-alert-glucose-monitor-sensor-issue-abbott-diabetes-care"" target=""_blank"">recalled some of its CGMs</a> due to inaccurate low glucose readings. The recall affects approximately 3 million sensors and was caused by an issue with one of Abbott’s production lines. </span></p><p>The discrepancy between reported accuracy and user experience, however, goes beyond any one company’s manufacturing missteps. </p><h2>Does MARD Matter? </h2><p>The accuracy of CGM systems is frequently measured via “mean absolute relative difference,” or MARD, a percentage that compares the sensor readings to laboratory blood glucose measurements. The lower the MARD, the more accurate the sensor. </p><p>This number is often used in advertising and marketing, and it has a historical relevance, says <a href=""https://de.linkedin.com/in/manueich/de"" target=""_blank"">Manuel Eichenlaub</a>, a biomedical engineer at the <a href=""https://www.ifdt-ulm.de/en/"" target=""_blank"">Institute for Diabetes Technology Ulm</a> in Germany, where he and his colleagues conduct independent CGM performance studies. For years, there was <a href=""https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/dia.2023.0435"" target=""_blank"">a general belief</a> that a MARD under 10 percent meant a system would be accurate enough to be used for insulin dosing. In 2018, the FDA established a specific set of accuracy <a href=""https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-H/part-862/subpart-B/section-862.1355"" target=""_blank"">requirements</a> beyond MARD for insulin-guiding glucose monitors, including Dexcom’s. But manufacturers design the clinical trials that determine accuracy metrics, and the way studies are designed can make a big difference. </p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Graph comparing readings from two glucose monitors from 12 AM to 2:24 PM.

But glucose levels vary across blood compartments in the body; blood collected from capillaries with a finger prick fluctuates more and can have glucose levels around 5 to 10 percent higher than venous blood. (Dexcom tests against a gold-standard venous blood analyzer. When users see inaccuracies against home meters that use capillary blood, it could in part be a reflection of the meter’s own inaccuracy, Simpson says, though he acknowledges real inaccuracies in CGMs as well.)</p><p>Additionally, the distribution of sampling isn’t standardized.

An expert in AI and machine learning, the IEEE senior member worked on Microsoft’s <a href=""https://www.bing.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Bing</a> search engine before moving to Amazon. He also developed several features for <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Microsoft Teams</a>, the company’s direct messaging platform.</p><p>“I’ve been working in AI for more than 20 years now,” he says. ”Seeing how much we can do with technology still amazes me.”</p><p>He shares his expertise and passion for the technology as an active member and volunteer at the <a href=""https://ieee-seattle.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">IEEE Seattle Section</a>. He organizes and hosts career development workshops that teach people to create an AI agent, which can perform tasks autonomously with minimal human oversight.</p><h2>An AI career inspired by a computer</h2><p>Agrawal was born and raised in Chirgaon, a remote village in Uttar Pradesh, India. When he was growing up, no one in Chirgaon had a computer. His family owned a pharmacy, which Agrawal was expected to join after he graduated from high school. Instead, his uncle and older brother encouraged him to attend college and find his own passion.</p><p>He enjoyed mathematics and physics, and he decided to pursue a bachelor’s degree in statistics at the <a href=""https://www.allduniv.ac.in/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">University of Allahabad</a>. After graduating in 1996, he pursued a master’s degree<strong> </strong>in statistics, statistical quality control, and operations research<strong> </strong>at the <a href=""https://www.isical.ac.in/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Indian Statistical Institute</a> in Kolkata.</p><p>While at the ISI, he saw a computer for the first time in the laboratory of <a href=""https://www.isical.ac.in/~nikhil/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Nikhil R. Pal</a>, an electronics and communication sciences professor. Pal worked on identifying abnormal clumps of cells in mammogram images using the<a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/413225/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> fuzzy c-means model</a>, a data-clustering technique employing a machine learning algorithm.</p><p>Agrawal earned his master’s degree in 1998. He was so inspired by Pal’s work, he says, that he stayed on at the university to earn a second master’s degree, in computer science.</p><p>After graduating in 2001, he joined <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Novell</a> as a senior software engineer working out of its Bengaluru office in India. He helped develop <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFolder"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">iFolder</a>, a storage platform that allows users across different computers to back up, access, and manage their files.</p><p>After four years, Agrawal left Novell to join Microsoft as a software design engineer, working at the company’s <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/hyderabad-campus"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Hyderabad campus</a> in India. He was part of a team developing a system to upgrade Microsoft’s software from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">XP</a> to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Vista</a>.</p><p>Two years later, he was transferred to the group developing Bing, a replacement for Microsoft’s Live Search, which had been launched in 2006.</p><h2>Improving Microsoft’s search engine</h2><p>Live Search had a traffic rate of less than 2 percent and struggled to keep up with <a href=""https://www.google.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Google</a>’s faster-paced, more user-friendly system, Agrawal says. He was tasked with improving search results but, Agrawal says, he and his team didn’t have enough user search data to train their machine learning model.</p><p>Data for location-specific queries, such as nearby coffee shops or restaurants, was especially important, he says.</p><p>To overcome those challenges, the team used deterministic algorithms to create a more structured search. Such algorithms give the same answers for any query that uses the same specific terms. The process gets results by taking keywords—such as locations, dates, and prices—and finding them on webpages. To help the search engine understand what users need, Agrawal developed a query clarifier that asked them to refine their search. The machine learning tool then ranked the results from most to least relevant.</p><p>To test new features before they were launched, Agrawal and his team built an online A/B experimentation platform. Controlled tests were completed on different versions of the products, and the platform ran performance and user engagement metrics, then it produced a scorecard to show changes for updated features.</p><p>Bing launched in 2009 and is now the world’s second-largest search engine, according to<a href=""https://blackraven.digital/the-rise-of-bing-and-how-it-differs-from-google/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> Black Raven</a>.</p><p>Throughout his 10 years of working on the system, Agrawal upgraded it. He also worked with the advertising department to improve Microsoft’s services on Bing. Ads relevant to a person’s search are listed among the search results.</p><p>“The work seems easy,” Agrawal says, “but behind every search engine are hundreds of engineers powering ads, query formulations, rankings, relevance, and location detection.”</p><h2>Testing products before launch </h2><p>Agrawal was promoted to software development manager in 2010. Five years later he was transferred to Microsoft’s Seattle offices. At the time, the company was deploying new features for existing platforms without first testing them to ensure effectiveness. Instead, they measured their performance after release, Agrawal says, and that was wreaking havoc.</p><p>He proposed using his online A/B experimentation platform on all Microsoft products, not just Bing. His supervisor approved the idea. In six months Agrawal and his team modified the tool for company-wide use. Thanks to the platform, he says, Microsoft was able to smoothly deploy up-to-date products to users.</p><p>After another two years, he was promoted to principal engineering manager of Microsoft Teams, which was facing issues with user experience, he says.</p><p>“Many employees received between 50 and 100 messages a day—which became overwhelming for them,” Agrawal says. To lessen the stress, he led a team that developed the system’s first machine learning feature: Trending. It prioritized the five most important messages users should focus on. Agrawal also led the launch of incorporating emoji reactions, screen sharing, and video calls for Teams.</p><p>In 2020 he was ready for new experiences, he says, and he left Microsoft to join Amazon as an engineering leader.</p><h2>Improved Amazon shopping</h2><p>Agrawal led an Amazon team that manually collected information about products from the company’s retail catalog to create a glossary. The data, which included product dimensions, color, and manufacturer, was used to standardize the language found in product descriptions to keep listings more consistent.</p><p>That is especially important when it comes to third-party sellers, he notes. Sellers listing a product had been entering as much or as little information as they wanted. Agrawal built a system that automatically suggests language from the glossary as the seller types.</p><p>He also developed an AI algorithm that utilizes the glossary’s terminology to refine search results based on what a user types into the search bar. When a shopper types “red mixer,” for example, the algorithm lists products under the search bar that match the description. The shopper can then click on a product from the list.</p><p>In 2023 the retailer’s catalog became too large for Agrawal and his team to collect information manually, so they built an AI tool to do it for them. It became the foundation for Amazon’s Catalog AI system.</p><p>After gathering information about products from around the Web, Catalog AI uses large language models to update Amazon listings with missing information, correct errors, and rewrite titles and product specifications to make them clearer for the customer, Agrawal says.</p><p>The company expects the AI tool to increase sales this year by US $7.5 billion, according to a <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/tech/amazons-ai-wants-own-online-shopping-data"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Fox News report</a> in July.</p><h2>Finding purpose at IEEE</h2><p>Since Agrawal joined IEEE last December, he has been elevated to senior member and has become an active volunteer.</p><p>“Being part of IEEE has opened doors for collaboration, mentorship, and professional growth,” he says. “IEEE has strengthened both my technical knowledge and my leadership skills, helping me progress in my career.”</p><p>Agrawal is the social media chair of the IEEE Seattle Section. He is also vice chair of the <a href=""https://cis.ieee.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">IEEE Computational Intelligence Society</a>.</p><p>He was a workshop cochair for the <a href=""https://attend.ieee.org/neweraai25/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">IEEE New Era AI World Leaders Summit</a>, which was held from 5 to 7 December in Seattle. The event brought together government and industry leaders, as well as researchers and innovators working on AI, intelligent devices, <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-weapons"" target=""_self"">unmanned aerial vehicles</a>, and similar technologies. They explored how new tools could be used in cybersecurity, the medical field, and national disaster rescue missions.</p><p>Agrawal says he stays up to date on cutting-edge technologies by peer-reviewing 15 IEEE journals.</p><p>“The organization plays a very important role in bringing authenticity to anything that it does,” he says. “If a journal article has the IEEE logo, you can believe that it was <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-research-integrity-process"" target=""_self"">thoroughly and diligently reviewed</a>.”</p>",https://spectrum.ieee.org/abhishek-agrawal-amazon-catalog-ai,Joanna Goodrich,"Amazon,Artificial intelligence,Ieee member news,Machine learning,Microsoft,Type:ti,User experience",spectrum.ieee.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""IEEE Spectrum"",""url"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/rss/fulltext"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""media""},""raw"":{""id"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/abhishek-agrawal-amazon-catalog-ai""}}"

He explained that he “didn’t know who was looking” at his blood sugar data.</span></p><p>This wasn’t a man unfamiliar with technology—he had successfully used computers for decades in his career. He was of sound mind. But when it came to his health device, he couldn’t find clear answers about where his data went, who could access it, or how to control it. The instructions were dense, and the <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/protecting-online-privacy"" target=""_blank"">privacy settings</a> were buried in multiple menus. So, he made what seemed like the safest choice: he unplugged it. That decision meant giving up real-time glucose monitoring that his doctor had recommended.</p><p>The healthcare IoT (Internet of Things) market is <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iot-healthcare-market-worth-289-140000086.html"" target=""_blank"">projected</a> to exceed $289 billion by 2028, with older adults representing a major share of users. These devices are fall detectors, medication reminders, glucose monitors, heart rate trackers, and others that enable independent living. Yet there’s a widening gap between deployment and adoption. According to an <a href=""https://www.aarp.org/personal-technology/companies-address-online-privacy-concerns/"" target=""_blank"">AARP survey</a>, 34% of adults over 50 list privacy as a primary barrier to adopting health technology. That represents millions of people who could benefit from monitoring tools but avoid them because they don’t feel safe.</p><p>In my study at the University of Denver’s Ritchie School of Engineering and Computer Science, I surveyed 22 older adults and conducted in-depth interviews with nine participants who use health-monitoring devices. The findings revealed a critical engineering failure: 82% understood security concepts like <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/two-factor-authentication-sandia-labs"" target=""_blank"">two-factor authentication</a> and <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/homomorphic-encryption"" target=""_blank"">encryption</a>, yet only 14% felt confident managing their privacy when using these devices. In my research, I also evaluated 28 healthcare apps designed for older adults and found that 79% lacked basic breach-notification protocols.</p><p>One participant told me, “I know there’s encryption, but I don’t know if it’s really enough to protect my data.” Another said, “The thought of my health data getting into the wrong hands is very concerning. I’m particularly worried about identity theft or my information being used for scams.”</p><p>This is not a user knowledge problem; it’s an engineering problem. We’ve built systems that demand technical expertise to operate safely, then handed them to people managing complex health needs while navigating age-related changes in vision, cognition, and dexterity.</p><h2>Measuring the Gap</h2><p>To quantify the issues with privacy setting transparency, I developed the Privacy Risk Assessment Framework (PRAF), a tool that scores healthcare apps across five critical domains.</p><p>First, the regulatory compliance domain evaluates whether apps explicitly state adherence to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or other data protection standards. Just claiming to be compliant is not enough—they must provide verifiable evidence.</p><p>Second, the security mechanisms<strong> </strong>domain assesses the implementation of encryption, access controls, and, most critically, breach-notification protocols that alert users when their data may have been compromised. Third, in the usability and accessibility domain, the tool examines whether privacy interfaces are readable and navigable for people with age-related visual or cognitive changes. Fourth, data-minimization practices evaluate whether apps collect only necessary information and clearly specify retention periods. Finally, third-party sharing transparency measures whether users can easily understand who has access to their data and why.</p><p>When I applied PRAF to 28 healthcare apps commonly used by older adults, the results revealed systemic gaps. Only 25% explicitly stated HIPAA compliance, and just 18% mentioned GDPR compliance. Most alarmingly, 79% lacked breach notification protocols, which means that the users may never find out if their data was compromised. The average privacy policy readability scored at a 12th-grade level, even though <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16541986/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">research shows</a> that the average reading level of older adults is at an 8th grade level<strong>. </strong>Not a single app included accessibility accommodations in their privacy interfaces.</p><p>Consider what happens when an older adult opens a typical health app. They face a multi-page privacy policy full of legal terminology about “data controllers” and “processing purposes,” followed by settings scattered across multiple menus. One participant told me, “The instructions are hard to understand, the print is too small, and it’s overwhelming.” Another explained, “I don’t feel adequately informed about how my data is collected, stored, and shared. It seems like most of these companies are after profit, and they don’t make it easy for users to understand what’s happening with their data.”</p><p>When protection requires a manual people can’t read, two outcomes follow: they either skip security altogether leaving themselves vulnerable, or abandon the technology entirely, forfeiting its health benefits.</p><h2>Engineering for privacy</h2><p>We need to treat trust as an engineering specification, not a marketing promise. Based on my research findings and the specific barriers older adults face, three approaches address the root causes of distrust.</p><p>The first approach is adaptive security defaults. Rather than requiring users to navigate complex configuration menus, devices should ship with pre-configured best practices that automatically adjust to data sensitivity and device type. A fall detection system doesn’t need the same settings as a continuous glucose monitor. This approach draws from the principle of “security by default” in systems engineering.</p><p>Biometric or voice authentication can replace passwords that are easily forgotten or written down. The key is removing the burden of expertise while maintaining strong protection. As one participant put it: “Simplified security settings, better educational resources, and more intuitive user interfaces will be beneficial.”</p><p>The second approach is real-time transparency<strong>.</strong> Users shouldn’t have to dig through settings to see where their data goes. Instead, notification systems should show each data access or sharing event in plain language. For example: “Your doctor accessed your heart-rate data at 2 p.m. to review for your upcoming appointment.” A single dashboard should summarize who has access and why.</p><p>This addresses a concern that came up repeatedly in my interviews: users want to know who is seeing their data and why. The engineering challenge here isn’t technical complexity, it’s designing interfaces that convey technical realities in language anyone can understand. Such systems already exist in other domains; banking apps, for instance, send immediate notifications for every transaction. The same principle applies to health data, where the stakes are arguably higher.</p><p>The third approach is invisible security updates. Manual patching creates vulnerability windows. Automatic, seamless updates should be standard for any device handling health data, paired with a simple status indicator so users can confirm protection at a glance. As one participant said, “The biggest issue that we as seniors have is the fact that we don’t remember our passwords... The new technology is surpassing the ability of seniors to keep up with it.” Automating updates removes a significant source of anxiety and risk.</p><h2>What’s at Stake</h2><p>We can keep building healthcare IoT the way we have: fast, feature-rich, and fundamentally untrustworthy. Or, we can engineer systems that are transparent, secure, and usable by design. Trust isn’t something you market through slogans or legal disclaimers. It’s something you engineer, line by line, into the code itself.<strong> </strong>For older adults relying on technology to maintain independence, that kind of engineering matters more than any new feature we could add. Every unplugged glucose monitor, every abandoned fall detector, every health app deleted out of confusion or fear represents not just a lost sale but a missed opportunity to support someone’s health and autonomy.</p><p>The challenge of privacy in healthcare IoT goes beyond fixing existing systems, it requires reimagining how we communicate privacy itself. My ongoing research builds on these findings through an AI-driven Data Helper, a system that uses large language models to translate dense legal privacy policies into short, accurate, and accessible summaries for older adults. By making data practices transparent and comprehension measurable, this approach aims to turn compliance into understanding and trust, thus advancing the next generation of trustworthy digital health systems.</p>",https://spectrum.ieee.org/privacy-health-tech-seniors,Suleiman Saka,"Iot,Healthcare,Privacy,Seniors",spectrum.ieee.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""IEEE Spectrum"",""url"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/rss/fulltext"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""media""},""raw"":{""id"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/privacy-health-tech-seniors""}}"

What do you mean by that?</strong></p><p><strong>Melanie Mitchell:</strong> Hopefully you noticed the quotation marks around “alien intelligences.” I’m quoting from a paper by [the neural network pioneer] <a href=""https://www.salk.edu/scientist/terrence-sejnowski/"" target=""_blank"">Terrence Sejnowski</a> where he talks about ChatGPT as <a href=""https://papers.cnl.salk.edu/PDFs/Large%20Language%20Models%20and%20the%20Reverse%20Turing%20Test%202023-4640.pdf"" target=""_blank"">being like a space alien</a> that can communicate with us and seems intelligent. And then there’s another paper by the developmental psychologist <a href=""https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Frank</a> who plays on that theme and says, <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-023-00211-x"" target=""_blank"">we in developmental psychology study alien intelligences</a>, namely babies. And we have some methods that we think may be helpful in analyzing AI intelligence. So that’s what I’m playing on.</p><p><strong>When people talk about evaluating intelligence in AI, what kind of intelligence are they trying to measure? Reasoning or abstraction or world modeling or something else?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> All of the above. People mean different things when they use the word intelligence, and intelligence itself has all these different dimensions, as you say. So, I used the term cognitive capabilities, which is a little bit more specific. I’m looking at how different cognitive capabilities are evaluated in developmental and comparative psychology and trying to apply some principles from those fields to AI.</p><h2>Current Challenges in Evaluating AI Cognition</h2><p><strong>You say that the field of AI lacks good experimental protocols for evaluating cognition. What does AI evaluation look like today?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> The typical way to evaluate an AI system is to have some set of <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/benchmarks"" target=""_blank"">benchmarks</a>, and to run your system on those benchmark tasks and report the accuracy. But often it turns out that even though these AI systems we have now are just killing it on benchmarks, they’re surpassing humans, that performance doesn’t often translate to performance in the real world. If an AI system aces the bar exam, that doesn’t mean it’s going to be a good lawyer in the real world. Often the machines are doing well on those particular questions but can’t generalize very well. Also, tests that are designed to assess humans make assumptions that aren’t necessarily relevant or correct for AI systems, about things like how well a system is able to memorize.</p><p>As a computer scientist, I didn’t get any training in experimental methodology. Doing experiments on AI systems has become a core part of evaluating systems, and most people who came up through computer science haven’t had that training.</p><p><strong>What do developmental and comparative psychologists know about probing cognition that AI researchers should know too?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> There’s all kinds of experimental methodology that you learn as a student of psychology, especially in fields like developmental and comparative psychology because those are nonverbal agents. You have to really think creatively to figure out ways to probe them. So they have all kinds of methodologies that involve very careful control experiments, and making lots of variations on stimuli to check for robustness. They look carefully at failure modes, why the system [being tested] might fail, since those failures can give more insight into what’s going on than success.</p><p><strong>Can you give me a concrete example of what these experimental methods look like in developmental or comparative psychology?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> One classic example is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans"" target=""_blank"">Clever Hans</a>. There was this horse, Clever Hans, who seemed to be able to do all kinds of arithmetic and counting and other numerical tasks. And the horse would tap out its answer with its hoof. For years, people studied it and said, “I think it’s real. It’s not a hoax.” But then <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Pfungst"" target=""_blank"">a psychologist</a> came around and said, “I’m going to think really hard about what’s going on and do some control experiments.” And his control experiments were: first, put a blindfold on the horse, and second, put a screen between the horse and the question asker. Turns out if the horse couldn’t see the question asker, it couldn’t do the task. What he found was that the horse was actually perceiving very subtle facial expression cues in the asker to know when to stop tapping. So it’s important to come up with alternative explanations for what’s going on. To be skeptical not only of other people’s research, but maybe even of your own research, your own favorite hypothesis. I don’t think that happens enough in AI.</p><p><strong>Do you have any case studies from research on babies?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> I have one case study where babies were <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06288.epdf?sharing_token=NaXcdNfjn_ktn5ri3QG45tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0O8aD3KLw-45u9i6UpdAHsxWqm0w4l5z_rcCGu3oMzrydMb---fq01I0LBO5y_TRS_vrnUazfwqqCeiiPTOnsikTBil18Nzkcus3pGuA01UVQr-9DWge0nHwMu5X8gIJgjH90R2IqNR_-8WhIWaEnYnrp4uNLHP54XXfeAQ8FDjt23U-hFVTZg4liviDOMhx5rlatVpfpWvuJ20bMzUGaM8lAw7Q5ccGolZw_BrVmTM6frTBEOkijW7qIckKcTNQdT8gIkRtC2pNc_WiQDIENEvqe2L2Ko_9sZIOkJNoC3Qlg%3D%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.smithsonianmag.com"" target=""_blank"">claimed to have an innate moral sense</a>. The experiment showed them videos where there was a cartoon character trying to climb up a hill. In one case there was another character that helped them go up the hill, and in the other case there was a character that pushed them down the hill. So there was the helper and the hinderer. And the babies were assessed as to which character they liked better—and they had a couple of ways of doing that—and overwhelmingly they liked the helper character better. [Editor's note: The babies were 6 to 10 months old, and assessment techniques included seeing whether the babies reached for the helper or the hinderer.]</p><p>But another research group looked very carefully at these videos and found that in all of the helper videos, the climber who was being helped was excited to get to the top of the hill and bounced up and down. And so they said, “Well, what if in the hinderer case we have the climber bounce up and down at the bottom of the hill?” And that <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042698"" target=""_blank"">completely turned around the results</a>. The babies always chose the one that bounced.</p><p>Again, coming up with alternatives, even if you have your favorite hypothesis, is the way that we do science. One thing that I’m always a little shocked by in AI is that people use the word skeptic as a negative: “You’re an LLM skeptic.” But our job is to be skeptics, and that should be a compliment.</p><h2>Importance of Replication in AI Studies</h2><p><strong>Both those examples illustrate the theme of looking for counter explanations. Are there other big lessons that you think AI researchers should draw from psychology?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> Well, in science in general the idea of replicating experiments is really important, and also building on other people’s work. But that’s sadly a little bit frowned on in the AI world. If you submit a paper to NeurIPS, for example, where you replicated someone’s work and then you do some incremental thing to understand it, the reviewers will say, “This lacks novelty and it’s incremental.” That’s the kiss of death for your paper. I feel like that should be appreciated more because that’s the way that good science gets done.</p><p><strong>Going back to measuring cognitive capabilities of AI, there’s lots of talk about how we can </strong><a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/agi-benchmark"" target=""_self""><strong>measure progress towards AGI</strong></a><strong>. Is that a whole other batch of questions?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> Well, the term AGI is a little bit nebulous. People define it in different ways. I think it’s hard to measure progress for something that’s not that well defined. And our conception of it keeps changing, partially in response to things that happen in AI. In the old days of AI, people would talk about human-level intelligence and robots being able to do all the physical things that humans do. But people have looked at robotics and said, “Well, okay, it’s not going to get there soon. Let’s just talk about what people call the cognitive side of intelligence,” which I don’t think is really so separable. So I am a bit of an AGI skeptic, if you will, in the best way.</p>",https://spectrum.ieee.org/melanie-mitchell,Eliza Strickland,"Benchmarks,Psychology,Animals,Infants,Artificial general intelligence",spectrum.ieee.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""IEEE Spectrum"",""url"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/rss/fulltext"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""media""},""raw"":{""id"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/melanie-mitchell""}}"

BYD’s real innovation is pulling it into a price range where everyday drivers in Brazil can actually choose ratios of ethanol and gasoline, as well as electric.”</p><h2>BYD’s Affordable Hybrid Innovation</h2><p>BYD Song Pro vehicles<span> </span>with this new engine were initially priced in a promotion <a href=""https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/byd-song-pro-2026-debuts-with-1-electric-engine-5-hp-and-up-to-235-km-in-electric-mode-but-price-is-still-higher-than-that-of-toyota-corolla-cross-afch"" target=""_blank"">at around US $25,048</a>, with a list price around $35,000. For comparison, another plug-in hybrid vehicle, Toyota’s 2026 Prius Prime, starts at <a target=""_blank""></a>$33,775. The engine is the product of an <a href=""https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2740741-byd-unveils-gasoline-ethanol-engine-opens-brazil-plant"" target=""_blank"">$18.5 million investment by BYD</a> and a collaboration between Brazilian and Chinese scientists. It<span> </span>adds to Brazil’s history of ethanol use that began in the 1930s and progressed from ethanol-only to flex-fuel vehicles, providing consumers a tool kit to respond to changing fuel prices, ongoing drought like Brazil <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0162-5"" target=""_blank"">experienced in the 1980s</a>, or emissions goals.</p><p>An engine switching between gasoline and ethanol needs<span> </span>a sensor that can reconcile two distinct fuel-air mixtures. “Integrating that control system, especially in a hybrid architecture, is not trivial,” says Wooldridge. “But BYD appears to have engineered it in a way that’s cost-effective.”</p><p>By leveraging a smaller, downsized hybrid engine, the company is likely able to design the engine to be optimal over a smaller speed map—a narrower, specific range of speeds and power output—avoiding some efficiency compromises that have long plagued flex-fuel power-train engines, says Wooldridge.</p><p>In general, standard flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs) have an internal combustion engine and can operate on gasoline and any blend of gasoline and ethanol up to 83 percent, <a href=""https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/how-do-flexible-fuel-cars-work"" target=""_blank"">according to the U.S. Department of Energy</a>. FFV engines have only  one fuel system, and mostly use components that are the same as those found in gasoline-only cars. To compensate for ethanol’s different chemical properties and power output compared to gasoline, special components modify the fuel pump and fuel-injection system. In addition, FFV engines have engine control modules<span> </span>calibrated to accommodate ethanol’s higher oxygen content.</p><p>“Flex-fuel gives consumers flexibility,” Wooldridge says. “If you’re using ethanol, you can run at a higher compression ratio, allowing molecules to be squeezed into a smaller space to allow for faster, more powerful and more efficient combustion. Increasing that ratio boosts efficiency and lowers knock—but if you’re also tying in electric drive, the system can stay optimally efficient across different modes,” she adds.</p><p><a href=""https://history.osu.edu/people/eaglin.5"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Eaglin</a>, a historian of Brazilian energy at Ohio State University, in Columbus, says that BYD is tapping into something deeply rooted in the culture of Brazil, the world’s seventh-most populous country (with a population of around 220 million).</p><p>“Brazil has built an ethanol-fuel system that’s durable and widespread,” Eaglin says. “It’s no surprise that a company like BYD, recognizing that infrastructure, would innovate to give consumers more options.

Carrington says CMF overcomes these issues.</p><p>“Our primary customers tend to come from the energy, defense, and aerospace industries,” says Carrington. “One large defense contractor recently switched from traditional 3D printing to CMF as it will save them millions and reduce prototyping and parts production by months.”</p><h2>How CMF Enhances Titanium 3D Printing Efficiency</h2><p>CMF combines the flexibility of 3D printing with new powder metallurgy processes to provide strength and greater durability to parts made from titanium and many other metals and alloys. The process uses a combination of proprietary metal powder and polymer binding agents that are fused layer by layer to create high-strength metal components.</p><p>The process begins like any other <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/mechanical-metamaterials-and-other-3d-printing-tech-from-chi-2017"" target=""_blank"">3D printing project</a>: A digital file that represents the desired 3D object directs the actions of a standard industrial 3D printer in laying down a mixture of metal and a plastic binder. A laser lightly fuses each layer of powder into a cohesive solid structure. Excess powder is removed for reuse.</p><p>Where CMF differs is that the initial parts generated by this stage of the process are strong enough for grinding, drilling, and milling if required. The parts then soak in a solvent to dissolve the plastic binder. Next, they go into a furnace to burn off any remaining binder, fuse the metal particles, and compact them into a dense metal component. Surface or finishing treatments can then be applied such as polishing and heat treatment.</p><p>“Our cold metal fusion technology offers a process that is at least three times faster and more scalable than any other kind of 3D printing,” says Carrington. “Per-part prices are generally 50 to 60 percent less than alternative metal 3D printing technology. We expect those prices to go down even more as we scale.”</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25"" style=""float: left;""> <img alt=""Shiny silver turbine wheel with blades, placed on a dark textured surface."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""ec031"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/shiny-silver-turbine-wheel-with-blades-placed-on-a-dark-textured-surface.jpg?id=62225237&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">3D printing with metal powders such as titanium makes it possible to create parts with complex geometries.</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">CADmore Metal</small></p><p>The material used in CMF was developed by <a href=""https://www.headmade-materials.de/en/"" target=""_blank"">Headmade Materials</a>, a German company.

CADmore Metal serves as the exclusive North American distributor for the metal powders used in CMF. The company can also serve as a systems integrator for the entire process by providing the printing and sintering hardware, the specialized powders, process expertise, training, and technical support.</p><p>“We provide guidance on design optimization and integration with existing workflows to help customers maximize the technology’s benefits,” says Carrington. “If a turbine company comes to us to produce their parts using CMF, we can either build the parts for them as a service or set them up to carry out their own production internally while we supply the powder and support.”</p><p>With the global 3D printing market now worth almost US $5 billion and predicted to reach $13 billion by 2035, according to analyst firm <a href=""https://www.idtechex.com/"" target=""_blank"">IDTechEx</a>, the arrival of CMF is timely.

In 2017 she won an<a href=""https://www.automate.org/robotics/engelberger/joseph-f-engelberger-awards"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> Engelberger Robotics Award</a> from the<a href=""https://www.automate.org/companies/robotic-industries-association"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> Robotic Industries Association</a>.

Her early life unfolded in a world defined by scarcity—rationed food, intermittent electricity, and a limited ability to move up or out. But she recalls that, amid the stifling insufficiencies, she was surrounded by an irrepressible warmth and intellectual curiosity—even when she was making locomotive screws in a state-run factory as part of her school’s curriculum.</p><p>“Life was hard,” she says, “but we had great teachers and strong communities. As a child, you adapt to whatever is around you.”</p><p>Her father,<a href=""https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/teodor-rus"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> Teodor</a>, was a computer scientist and professor, and her mother, Elena, was a physicist.</p><p>In 1982, when she was 19, Rus’s father emigrated to the United States to join the faculty at the<a href=""https://uiowa.edu/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> University of Iowa</a>, in Iowa City. It was an act of courage and conviction. Within a year, Daniela and her mother joined him there.</p><p>“He wanted the freedom to think, to publish, to explore ideas,” Rus says. “And I reaped the benefits of being free from the limitations of our homeland.”</p><p>America’s open horizons were intoxicating, she says.</p><h2>A lecture that changed everything</h2><p>Rus decided to pursue a degree at her father’s university, where her life changed direction, she says. One afternoon, <a href=""https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/hopcroft_1053917.cfm"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">John Hopcroft</a>—a<a href=""https://amturing.acm.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> Turing Award</a>–winning <a href=""https://www.cornell.edu/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Cornell</a> computer scientist renowned for his work on algorithms and data structures—gave a talk on campus. His message was simple but electrifying, Rus says: Classical computer science had been solved. The next frontier, Hopcroft declared, was computations that interact with the messy physical world.</p><p>For Rus, the idea was a revelation.</p><p>“It was as if a door had opened,” she says. “I realized the future of computing wasn’t just about logic and code; it was about how machines can perceive, move, and help us in the real world.”</p><p>After the lecture, she introduced herself to Hopcroft and told him she wanted to learn from him. Not long after earning her bachelor’s degree in computer science and mathematics in 1985, she applied to get a master’s degree at Cornell, where Hopcroft became her graduate advisor. Rus developed algorithms there for dexterous <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/minimally-actuated-robot-arm-has-lots-of-joints-just-one-clever-motor"" target=""_self"">robotic manipulation</a>—teaching machines to grasp and move objects with precision. She earned her master’s in computer science in 1990, then stayed on at Cornell to work toward a doctorate.</p><p class=""pull-quote"">“I like to think of robotics as a way to give people superpowers. Machines can help us reach farther, think faster, and live fuller lives.”</p><p>In 1993 she earned her Ph.D. in computer science, then took a position as an assistant professor of computer science at <a href=""https://home.dartmouth.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Dartmouth College</a>, in Hanover, N.H. She founded the college’s robotics laboratory and expanded her work into distributed robotics. She developed teams of small robots that cooperated to perform tasks such as ensuring products in warehouses are correctly gathered to fulfill orders, get packaged safely, and are routed to their respective destinations efficiently.</p><p>Despite a lack of traditional machine shop facilities for fabrication on the Hanover campus, Rus found a way. She pioneered the use of<a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/printable-robots-mit-project"" target=""_self""> 3D printing to rapidly prototype and build robots</a>.</p><p>In 2003 she left Dartmouth to become a professor in the<a href=""https://www.eecs.mit.edu/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> electrical engineering and computer science</a> department at <a href=""https://www.mit.edu/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">MIT</a>.</p><p>The robotics lab she created at Dartmouth moved with her to MIT and became known as the <a href=""https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/distributed-robotics-laboratory"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Distributed Robotics Laboratory</a> (DRL). In 2012 she was named director of MIT’s<a href=""https://www.csail.mit.edu/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, the school’s largest interdisciplinary lab, with 60 research groups including the DRL. She also continues to serve as the DRL’s principal investigator.</p><h2>The science of physical intelligence</h2><p>Rus now leads pioneering research at the intersection of AI and robotics, a field she calls <a href=""https://news.mit.edu/news-clip/wired-451"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">physical intelligence</a>. It’s “a new form of intelligent machine that can understand dynamic environments, cope with unpredictability, and make decisions in real time,” <a href=""https://news.mit.edu/news-clip/wired-451"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">she says</a>.</p><p>Her lab builds <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/soft-robots-for-hard-problems"" target=""_self"">soft-body robots inspired by nature</a> that can sense, adapt, and learn. They are AI-driven systems that passively handle tasks—such as self-balancing and complex articulation similar to that done by the human hand—because their shape and materials minimize the need for heavy processing.</p><p>Such machines, she says, someday will be able to navigate different environments, perform useful functions without external control, and even recover from disturbances to their route planning. Researchers also are exploring ways to make them more energy-efficient.</p><p>One prototype developed by Rus’s team is designed to retrieve foreign objects from the body, including batteries swallowed by children. The ingestible robots are artfully folded, similar to origami, so they are small enough to be swallowed. Embedded magnetic materials allow doctors to steer the soft robots and control their shape. Upon arriving in the stomach, a soft bot can be programmed to wrap around a foreign object and guide it safely out of the patient’s body.</p><p>CSAIL researchers also are working on small robots that can carry a medication and release it at a specific area within the digestive tract, bypassing the stomach acid known to diminish some drugs’ efficacy. Ingestible robots also could patch up internal injuries or ulcers. And because they’re made from digestible materials such as sausage casings and biocompatible polymers, the robots can perform their assigned tasks and then get safely absorbed by the body, she says.</p><p>Health care isn’t the only application on the horizon for such AI-driven technologies. Robots with physical intelligence might someday help firefighters locate people trapped in burning buildings, find miners after a cave-in, and provide valuable situational awareness information to emergency response teams in the aftermath of natural disasters, Rus says.</p><p>“What excites me is the possibility of giving people new powers,” she says. “Machines that can think and move safely in the physical world will let us extend human reach—at work, at home, in medicine … everywhere.”</p><p>To make such a vision a reality, she has expanded her technical interests to include several complementary lines of research.</p><p>She’s working on self-reconfiguring and <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/stochastic-robots-assemble-and-disassemble-themselves"" target=""_self"">modular robots</a> such as MIT’s <a href=""https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/m-blocks-modular-robotics"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">M-Blocks</a> and NASA’s <a href=""https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/what-we-do/research-tasks/superbot-modular-multifunctional-reconfigurable-robot/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">SuperBots</a>, which can attach, detach, and rearrange themselves to form shapes suited for different actions such as slithering, climbing, and crawling.</p><p>With <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/nyu-tandon-robotics"" target=""_self"">networked robots</a>—including those <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/?tag=amazusnavi-20&amp;hvadid=675149237887&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=13161685782168516493&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9004281&amp;hvtargid=kwd-10573980&amp;ref=pd_sl_7j18redljs_e&amp;hydadcr=28883_14649097"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Amazon</a> uses in its warehouses—thousands of machines can operate as a large adaptive system. The machines communicate continuously to divide tasks, avoid collisions, and optimize package routing.</p><p>Rus’s team also is making advances in <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/human-robot-interaction"" target=""_self"">human-robot interaction</a>, such as reading brainwave activity and <a href=""https://www.josephdelpreto.com/portfolio/detect-sign-language-with-a-smart-glove/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">interpreting sign language through a smart glove</a>.</p><p>To further her plan of putting all the computerized smarts the robots need within their physical bodies instead of in the cloud, she helped found <a href=""https://www.liquid.ai/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Liquid AI</a> in 2023. The company, based in Cambridge, Mass., develops <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/liquid-neural-networks"" target=""_self"">liquid neural networks</a>, inspired by the simple brains of worms, that can learn and adapt continuously. The word <em><em>liquid</em></em> in this case refers to the adaptability, flexibility, and dynamic nature of the team’s model architecture. It can change shape and adapt to new data inputs, and it fits within constraints imposed by the hardware in which it’s contained, she says.</p><h2>Finding community in IEEE</h2><p>Rus joined IEEE at one of its robotics conferences when she was a graduate student.</p><p>“I think I signed up just to get the student discount,” she says with a laugh. “But IEEE turned out to be the place where my community lived.”</p><p>She credits the organization’s conferences, journals, and collaborative spirit with shaping her professional growth.</p><p>“The exchange of ideas, the chance to test your thinking against others—it’s invaluable,” she says. “It’s how our field moves forward.”</p><p>Rus continues to serve on IEEE panels and committees, mentoring the next generation of roboticists.</p><p>“IEEE gave me a platform,” Rus says. “It taught me how to communicate, how to lead, and how to dream bigger.”</p><h2>Living the American dream</h2><p>Looking back, Rus sees her story as a testament to unforeseen possibilities.</p><p>“When I was growing up in Romania, I couldn’t even imagine living in America,” she says. “Now I’m here, working with brilliant students, building robots that help people, and trying to make a difference. I feel like I’m living the American dream.”</p><p>In a nod to a memorable song from the Broadway musical <a href=""https://hamiltonmusical.com/new-york/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><em><em>Hamilton</em></em></a>, Rus echoes <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/alexander-hamilton.htm"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Alexander Hamilton</a>’s determination to make the most of his opportunities, saying, “I don’t ever want to throw away my shot.”</p>",https://spectrum.ieee.org/mits-ai-robotics-lab-director,Willie D.

When you find yourself in a toxic work environment, what should you do?</span></p><p>Is it worth trying to improve things over time, or should you just leave? </p><p>The difficult truth is that, in nearly every case, the answer is to leave a toxic team as soon as you can. Here’s why:</p><ul><li>If you’re earlier in your career, you frankly don’t have much political power in the organization. Any arguments to change team culture or address systemic problems will likely fall on deaf ears. You’ll end up frustrated, and your efforts will be wasted.</li><li>If you’re more senior, you have some ability to improve processes and relationships on the team. However, if you’re an individual contributor (IC), your capabilities are still limited. There is likely some “low-hanging fruit” of quick improvements to suggest. A few thoughtful pieces of feedback could address many of the problems. If you’ve done that and things are still not getting better, it’s probably time to leave.</li><li>If you’re part of upper management, you may have inherited the problem, or maybe you were even brought in to solve it. This is the rare case where you could consider the change scenario and address the broken culture: You have both the context and power to make a difference.</li></ul><p>The world of technology is large, and constantly getting larger. Don’t waste your time on a bad team or with a bad manager. Find another team, company, or start something on your own.</p><p>Engineers often hesitate to leave a poor work environment because they’re afraid or unsure about the process of finding something new. That’s a valid concern. However, inertia should not be the reason you stick around in a job. The best careers stem from the excitement of actively choosing your work, not tolerating toxicity.</p><p>Finally, it’s worth noting that even in a toxic team, you’ll still come across smart and kind people. If you are stuck on a bad team, seek out the people who match your wavelength.

Which brings industry scrutiny, then, to what telecom folks call backhaul—<a href=""https://www.trentonsystems.com/en-us/resource-hub/blog/wired-access-backhaul-vs-wireless-access-backhaul"" target=""_blank"">the high-capacity fiber or wireless links that pass data from cell towers toward the internet backbone</a>. It’s the difference between the “local” connection from your phone to a nearby tower and the “trunk” connection that carries millions of signals simultaneously. </p><p><span>But the backhaul crisis ahead isn’t just about capacity. It’s also about architecture. 5G was designed around a world where phones dominated, downloading video at higher and higher resolutions. 6G is now shaping up to be something else entirely. This inversion—from 5G’s anticipated downlink deluge to 6G’s uplink resurgence—requires rethinking everything at the core level, practically from scratch.</span></p><p>Vetter’s career spans the entire arc of the wireless telecom era—from optical interconnections in the 1990s at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatel_Mobile"" target=""_blank"">Alcatel</a> (a research center pioneering fiber-to-home connections) to his roles at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs"" target=""_blank"">Bell Labs</a> and later Nokia Bell Labs, culminating in 2021 in his current position at the industry’s bellwether institution.</p><p>In this conversation, held in November at the <a href=""https://www.b6gs.com/"" target=""_blank"">Brooklyn 6G Summit</a> in New York, Vetter explains what 5G got wrong, what 6G must do differently, and whether these innovations can arrive before telecom’s networks start running out of room.</p><h3>5G’s Expensive Miscalculation</h3><p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum: </em>Where is telecom today, halfway between 5G’s rollout and 6G’s anticipated rollout?</strong></p><p><strong>Peter Vetter: </strong>Today, we have enough spectrum and capacity. But going forward, there will not be enough. The 5G network by the end of the decade will run out of steam, as we see in our traffic simulations and forecasts. And it is something that has been consistent generation to generation, from 2G to 3G to 4G. Every decade, capacity goes up by about a factor of 10. So you need to prepare for that.</p><p>And the challenge for us as researchers is how do you do that in an energy-efficient way? Because the power consumption cannot go up by a factor of 10. The cost cannot go up by a factor of 10. And then, lesson learned from 5G: The idea was, “Oh, we do that in higher spectrum. There is more bandwidth. Let’s go to <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/5g-bytes-millimeter-waves-explained"" target=""_blank"">millimeter wave</a>.” The lesson learned is, okay, millimeter waves have short reach. You need a small cell [tower] every 300 meters or so. And that doesn’t cut it. It was too expensive to install all these small cells.</p><p><strong>Is this related to the backhaul question?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So backhaul is the connection between the base station and what we call the core of the network—the data centers, and the servers. Ideally, you use fiber to your base station. If you have that fiber as a service provider, use it. It gives you the highest capacity. But very often new cell sites don’t have that fiber backhaul, then there are alternatives: wireless backhaul.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Close-up of a Nokia radio on glass circuit board."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""c9af3"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-a-nokia-radio-on-glass-circuit-board.png?id=62261540&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">Nokia Bell Labs has pioneered a glass-based chip architecture for telecom’s backhaul signals, communicating between towers and telecom infrastructure.</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">Nokia</small></p><h3>Radios Built on Glass Push Frequencies Higher</h3><p><strong>What are the challenges ahead for wireless backhaul?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>To get up to the 100-gigabit-per-second, fiber-like speeds, you need to go to higher frequency bands.</p><p><strong>Higher frequency bands for the signals the backhaul antennas use?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>Yes. The challenge is the design of the radio front ends and the radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) at those frequencies. You cannot really integrate [present-day] antennas with RFICs at those high speeds.</p><p><strong>And what happens as those signal frequencies get higher?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So in a millimeter wave, say 28 gigahertz, you could still do [the electronics and waveguides] for this with a classical printed circuit board. But as the frequencies go up, the attenuation gets too high.</p><p><strong>What happens when you get to, say, 100 GHz?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>[Conventional materials] are no good anymore. So we need to look at other still low-cost materials. We have done pioneering work at Bell Labs on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzl0UHyRjRo"" target=""_blank"">radio on glass</a>. And we use glass not for its optical transparency, but for its transparency in the <a href=""https://www.rfwireless-world.com/terminology/sub-thz-bands-frequencies"" target=""_blank"">subterahertz radio range</a>.</p><p><strong>Is Nokia Bell Labs making these radio-on-glass backhaul systems for 100-GHz communications?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>Above 100 GHz, you need to look into a different material. I used an order of magnitude, but [the wavelength range] is actually 140 to 170 GHz, what is called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_band_(waveguide)"" target=""_blank"">D-Band</a>.<strong></strong></p><p>We collaborate with our internal customers to get these kind of concepts on the long-term road map. As an example, that D-Band radio system, we actually integrated it in a prototype with our mobile business group. And we tested it last year at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics"" target=""_blank"">Olympics in Paris</a>.<strong></strong></p><p>But this is, as I said, a prototype. We need to mature the technology between a research prototype and qualifying it to go into production. The researcher on that is <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DK2TMVgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"" target=""_blank"">Shahriar Shahramian</a>. He’s well-known in the field for this.</p><h3>Why 6G’s Bandwidth Crisis Isn’t About Phones</h3><p><strong>What will be the applications that’ll drive the big 6G demands for bandwidth?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>We’re installing more and more cameras and other types of sensors. I mean, we’re going into a world where we want to create large world models that are synchronous copies of the physical world. So what we will see going forward in 6G is a massive-scale deployment of sensors which will feed the AI models. So a lot of uplink capacity. That’s where a lot of that increase will come from.</p><p><strong>Any others?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>Autonomous cars could be an example. It can also be in industry—like a digital twin of a harbor, and how you manage that? It can be a digital twin of a warehouse, and you query the digital twin, “Where is my product X?” Then a robot will automatically know thanks to the updated digital twin where it is in the warehouse and which route to take. Because it knows where the obstacles are in real time, thanks to that massive-scale sensing of the physical world and then the interpretation with the AI models.</p><p>You will have your agents that act on behalf of you to do your groceries or order a driverless car. They will actively record where you are, make sure that there are also the proper privacy measures in place. So that your agent has an understanding of the state you’re in and can serve you in the most optimal way.</p><h3>How 6G Networks Will Help Detect Drones, Earthquakes, and Tsunamis</h3><p><strong>You’ve described before how 6G signals can not only transmit data but also provide sensing. How will that work?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>The augmentation now is that the network can be turned also in a sensing modality. That if you turn around the corner, a camera doesn’t see you anymore. But the radio still can detect people that are coming, for instance, at a traffic crossing. And you can anticipate that. Yeah, warn a car that, “There’s a pedestrian coming. Slow down.” We also have fiber sensing. And for instance, using fibers at the bottom of the ocean and detecting movements of waves and detect tsunamis, for instance, and do an early tsunami warning.</p><p><strong>What are your teams’ findings?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>The present-day use of tsunami warning buoys are a <a href=""https://phys.org/news/2024-12-tsunami-buoys-safeguarding-thailand.html"" target=""_blank"">few hundred kilometers offshore</a>. These tsunami waves travel at 300 and more meters per second, and so you only have 15 minutes to warn the people and evacuate. If you have now a fiber sensing network across the ocean that you can detect it much deeper in the ocean, you can do meaningful early tsunami warning.</p><p>We recently detected there was a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Kamchatka_earthquake"" target=""_blank"">major earthquake in East Russia</a>. That was last July. And we had a fiber sensing system between Hawaii and California. And we were able to see that earthquake on the fiber. And we also saw the development of the tsunami wave.</p><h3>6G’s Thousands of Antennas and Smarter Waveforms</h3><p><strong>Bell Labs was an early pioneer in multiple-input, multiple-output (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO"" target=""_blank"">MIMO</a>) antennas starting in the 1990s. Where multiple transmit and receive antennas could carry many data streams at once. What is Bell Labs doing with MIMO now to help solve these bandwidth problems you’ve described?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So, as I said earlier, you want to provide capacity from existing cell sites. And the way to MIMO can do that by a technology called a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming"" target=""_blank"">simplified beamforming</a>: If you want better coverage at a higher frequency, you need to focus your electromagnetic energy, your radio energy, even more. So in order to do that, you need a larger amount of antennas.</p><p>So if you double the frequency, we go from 3.5 GHz, which is the <a href=""https://www.digi.com/blog/post/what-is-c-band-and-why-is-it-important-for-5g"" target=""_blank"">C-band in 5G</a>, now to 6G, 7 GHz. So it’s about double. That means the wavelength is half. So you can fit four times more antenna elements in the same form factor. So physics helps us in that sense.</p><p><strong>What’s the catch?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>Where physics doesn’t help us is more antenna elements means more signal processing, and the power consumption goes up. So here is where the research then comes in. Can we creatively get to these larger antenna arrays without the power consumption going up?<strong></strong></p><p>The use of AI is important in this. How can we leverage AI to do channel estimation, to do such things as equalization, to do smart beamforming, to learn the waveform, for instance?</p><p>We’ve shown that with these kind of AI techniques, we can get actually up to 30 percent more capacity on the same spectrum.</p><p><strong>And that allows many gigabits per second to go out to each phone or device?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So gigabits per second is already possible in 5G. We’ve demonstrated that. You can imagine that this could go up, but that’s not really the need. The need is really how many more can you support from a base station?</p>",https://spectrum.ieee.org/6g-network-infrastructure-bell-labs,Margo Anderson,"6g,Ai agents,Autonomous cars,Digital twin,Drones,Nokia bell labs",spectrum.ieee.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""IEEE Spectrum"",""url"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/rss/fulltext"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""media""},""raw"":{""id"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/6g-network-infrastructure-bell-labs""}}"

Charette can be pretty depressing. Charette, who has been writing about software failures for this magazine for the past 20 years, is a renowned risk analyst and systems expert who over the course of a 50-year career has seen more than his share of delusional thinking among IT professionals, government officials, and corporate executives, before, during, and after massive software failures.</p><p>In 2005’s “<a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-software-fails"" target=""_self"">Why Software Fails</a>,” in <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>, a seminal article documenting the causes behind large-scale software failures, Charette noted, “The biggest tragedy is that <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-failure"" target=""_self"">software failure</a> is for the most part predictable and avoidable. Unfortunately, most organizations don’t see preventing failure as an urgent matter, even though that view risks harming the organization and maybe even destroying it. Understanding why this attitude persists is not just an academic exercise; it has tremendous implications for business and society.”</p><p>Two decades and several trillion wasted dollars later, he finds that <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/it-management-software-failures"" target=""_blank"">people are making the same mistakes</a>. They claim their project is unique, so past lessons don’t apply. They underestimate complexity. Managers come out of the gate with unrealistic budgets and timelines. Testing is inadequate<strong> </strong>or skipped entirely. Vendor promises that are too good to be true are taken at face value. Newer development approaches like DevOps or AI copilots are implemented without proper training or the organizational change necessary to make the most of them.</p><p>What’s worse, the huge impacts of these missteps on end users aren’t fully accounted for. When the Canadian government’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aurO_LK6DEI"" target=""_blank"">Phoenix paycheck system</a> initially failed, for instance, the developers glossed over the protracted financial and emotional distress inflicted on tens of thousands of employees receiving erroneous paychecks; problems persist today, nine years later. Perhaps that’s because, as Charette told me recently, IT project managers don’t have professional licensing requirements and are rarely, if ever, held legally liable for software debacles.</p><p>While medical devices may seem a far cry from giant IT projects, they have a few things in common. As Special Projects Editor Stephen Cass uncovered in this month’s <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/medical-device-recalls"" target=""_blank"">The Data</a>, the <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-recalls-and-early-alerts"" target=""_blank"">U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalls</a> on average 20 medical devices per month due to software issues.</p><p class=""pull-quote"">“Software is as significant as electricity. We would never put up with electricity going out every other day, but we sure as hell have no problem having AWS go down.” <strong>—Robert N. Charette</strong></p><p>Like IT projects, medical devices face fundamental challenges posed by software complexity. Which means that testing, though rigorous and regulated in the medical domain, can’t possibly cover every scenario or every line of code. The major difference between failed medical devices and failed IT projects is that a huge amount of liability attaches to the former.</p><p>“When you’re building software for medical devices, there are a lot more standards that have to be met and a lot more concern about the consequences of failure,” Charette observes. “Because when those things don’t work, there’s tort law available, which means manufacturers are on the hook. It’s much harder to bring a case and win when you’re talking about an electronic payroll system.”</p><p>Whether a software failure is hyperlocal, as when a medical device fails inside your body, or spread across an entire region, like when an airline’s ticketing system crashes, organizations need to dig into the root causes and apply those lessons to the next device or IT project if they hope to stop history from repeating itself.</p><p>“Software is as significant as electricity,” Charette says. “We would never put up with electricity going out every other day, but we sure as hell have no problem accepting AWS going down or telcos or banks going out.” He lets out a heavy sigh worthy of A.A. Milne’s Eeyore. “People just kind of shrug their shoulders.”</p>",https://spectrum.ieee.org/avoidable-software-failures-cost-trillions,Harry Goldstein,"Failed it projects,It professionals,Medical devices,Phoenix paycheck system,Software failures,Software",spectrum.ieee.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""IEEE Spectrum"",""url"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/rss/fulltext"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""media""},""raw"":{""id"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/avoidable-software-failures-cost-trillions""}}"

Yet engineering’s impact lies not only in technical advancement but also in its ability to serve the greater good. This foundational principle is behind IEEE’s public imperative initiatives which apply our efforts and expertise to support our mission to advance technology for humanity with a direct benefit to society. </p><h2>Serving society </h2><p>Public imperative activities and initiatives serve society by promoting understanding, impact for humans and our environment, and responsible use of science and technology. These initiatives encompass a wide range of efforts, including<a href=""https://move.ieeeusa.org/about/stem-outreach/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> STEM outreach</a>,<a href=""https://ieeeht.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> humanitarian technology deployments</a>,<a href=""https://ieeeusa.org/public-policy/priorities/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> public education on emerging technologies</a>, and<a href=""https://sustainable-climate.ieee.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> sustainability</a>. Unlike many efforts advancing technology, these initiatives are not designed with financial opportunity in mind. Instead, they fulfill IEEE’s designation as a 501(c)(3) public charity engaged in scientific and <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/microcredentials"" target=""_blank"">educational activities</a> for the benefit of the engineering community and the public.</p><h3>Building a Better World</h3><br /><p>Across the globe, IEEE members and volunteers dedicate their time and use their talents, experiences, and expertise to lead, organize, and drive activities to advance technology for humanity. The<a href=""https://www.ieee.org/advancing-technology/building-better-world/social-impact-report"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> IEEE Social Impact</a> report showcases a selection of recent projects and initiatives that support that mission.</p><p>In my March column, I described my vision for One IEEE, which is aimed at empowering IEEE’s diverse units to work together in ways that magnify their individual and collective impact. Within the framework of One IEEE, public imperative activities are not peripheral; they are central to unifying the organization and amplifying our global relevance. Across IEEE’s varied regions, societies, and technical communities, these activities align efforts around a shared mission. They provide our members from different disciplines and geographies the opportunity to collaborate on projects that transcend boundaries, fostering interdisciplinary innovation and global stewardship.</p><p>Such activities also offer members opportunities to apply their technical expertise in service of societal needs. Whether<a href=""https://ctu.ieee.org"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> finding innovative solutions to connect the unconnected</a> or developing<a href=""https://tryengineering.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> open-source educational tools for students</a>, we are solving real-world problems. The initiatives transform abstract technical knowledge into actionable solutions, reinforcing the idea that technology is not just about building systems—it’s about building futures.</p><p>For our <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/epics-in-ieee-student-projects"" target=""_blank"">young professionals and students</a>, these activities offer hands-on experiences that connect technical skills with real-world applications, inspiring the next generation to pursue careers in engineering with purpose and passion. These activities also create mentorship opportunities, leadership pathways, and a sense of belonging within the wider IEEE community.</p><h2>Principled tech leader</h2><p>In an age when technology influences practically every aspect of life—from health care and energy to communication and transportation—IEEE must, as a leading technical authority, also serve as a socially responsible leader. Public imperative activities include IEEE’s commitment to ethical development, university and pre-university education, and accessible innovation. They help bridge the gap between technical communities and the public, working to ensure that engineering solutions are accessible, equitable, and aligned with societal values.</p><p>From a strategic standpoint, public imperatives also support IEEE’s long-term sustainability. The organization is redesigning its budget process to emphasize aligning financial resources with mission-driven goals. One of the guiding principles is to publicize IEEE’s public charity status and invest accordingly.</p><p>That means promoting our public imperatives in funding decisions, integrating them into operational planning, and measuring their outcomes with engineering rigor. By treating these activities as core infrastructure, IEEE ensures that its resources are deployed in ways that maximize public benefit and organizational impact.</p><p>Public imperatives are vital to the success of One IEEE. They embody the organization’s mission, unify its global membership, and demonstrate the societal relevance of engineering and technology. They offer our members the opportunity to apply their skills in meaningful ways, contribute to public good, and shape the future of technology with integrity.</p><p>Through our public imperative activities, IEEE is a force for innovation and a driver of meaningful impact.</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as “<span>Engineering With Purpose</span>.”</em></p>",https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-presidents-note-dec-2025,Kathleen Kramer,"Ieee member news,Ieee presidents column,One ieee,Type:ti",spectrum.ieee.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""IEEE Spectrum"",""url"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/rss/fulltext"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""media""},""raw"":{""id"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-presidents-note-dec-2025""}}"

The next leap won’t come from bigger models alone<span>. I</span>t will come from combining ever-better data with worlds we build for models to learn in. And the most important question <span>becomes: What do classrooms for AI look like?</span></p><p><span>In the past few</span> month<span>s</span> Silicon Valley has placed its bets, <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-environments-to-train-ai-agents/"" target=""_blank""><span>with labs investing billions</span></a> in constructing <span>such </span>classrooms, which are called reinforcement learning (RL) environments. These environments let machines experiment, fail, and improve in realistic digital spaces. </p><h2>AI Training: From Data to Experience</h2><p>The history of modern AI has unfolded in eras, each defined by the kind of data that the models consumed. First came the age of pretraining on internet-scale datasets. This commodity data allowed machines to mimic human language by recognizing statistical patterns. Then came  <span>data combined</span> with reinforcement learning from human feedback—a technique that uses crowd workers to grade responses from LLMs—which made AI more useful, responsive, and aligned with human preferences.<br /></p><p>We have experienced both eras firsthand. Working in the trenches of model data <span>at <a href=""https://scale.com/"" target=""_blank"">Scale AI</a></span> exposed us to what many consider the fundamental problem in AI: ensuring that the <span>training </span>data fueling these models is diverse, accurate, and effective in driving performance gains. Systems trained on clean, structured, expert-labeled data made leaps. Cracking the data problem allowed us to pioneer some of the most critical advancements in LLMs over the past few years.</p><p>Today, data is still a foundation. It is the raw material from which intelligence is built. But we are entering a new phase where data alone is no longer enough. To unlock the next frontier, we must pair high-quality data with environments that allow limitless interaction, continuous feedback, and learning through action. RL environments don’t replace data; they amplify what data can do by enabling models to apply knowledge, test hypotheses, and refine behaviors in realistic settings.</p><h2>How an RL Environment Works</h2><p>In an RL environment, the model learns through a simple loop: it observes the state of the world, takes an action, and receives a reward that indicates whether that action helped accomplish a goal. Over many iterations, the model gradually discovers strategies that lead to better outcomes. The crucial shift is that training becomes interactive—models aren’t just predicting the next token but improving through trial, error, and feedback.</p><p>For example, language models can already generate code in a simple chat setting. Place them in a live coding environment<span>—</span>where they can ingest context, run their code, debug errors, and refine their solution<span>—</span>and something changes. They shift from advising to autonomously <span>problem-</span>solving.</p><p>This distinction matters. In a software-driven world, the ability for AI to generate and test production-level code in vast repositories will mark a <span>major</span> change in capability. That leap won’t come solely from larger datasets; it will come from immersive environments where agents can experiment, stumble, and learn through iteration—much like human programmers do. The real world of development is messy: Coders have to deal with underspecified bugs, tangled codebases, vague requirements. Teaching AI to handle that mess is the only way it will ever graduate from producing error-prone attempts to generating consistent and reliable solutions.</p><h2>Can AI Handle the Messy Real World?</h2><p>Navigating the internet is also messy. Pop-ups, login walls, broken links, and outdated information are woven throughout day-to-day browsing workflows. Humans handle these disruptions almost instinctively, but AI can only develop that capability by training in environments that simulate the web’s unpredictability. Agents must learn how to recover from errors, recognize and persist through user-interface obstacles, and complete multi-step workflows across widely used applications.</p><p>Some of the most important environments aren’t public at all. Governments and enterprises are actively building secure simulations where AI can practice high-stakes decision-making without real-world consequences. Consider disaster relief: It would be unthinkable to deploy an untested agent in a live hurricane response. But in a simulated world of ports, roads, and supply chains, an agent can fail a thousand times and gradually get better at crafting the optimal plan.</p><p>Every major leap in AI has relied on unseen infrastructure, such as annotators labeling datasets, researchers training reward models, and engineers building scaffoldings for LLMs to use tools and take action. <span>Finding l</span>arge-volume and high-quality datasets <span>was </span>once the bottleneck in AI, and solving that problem sparked the previous wave of progress. Today, the bottleneck is not data—it’s building RL environments that are rich, realistic, and truly useful.</p><p><span>The next phase of AI progress</span> won’t be an accident of scale.

It came with a set of cookware, including a frying pan, a pot with lid, a muffin tin, a tea kettle, and a wooden potato masher. I would have also expected a spoon, whisk, or spatula, but maybe most girls already had those. Just plug in the toy, and housewives-in-training could mimic their mothers frying eggs, baking muffins, or boiling water for tea.</p><h2>A brief history of toy stoves</h2><p>Even before electrification, cast-iron toy stoves had become popular in the mid-19th century. At first fueled by coal or alcohol and later by oil or gas, these toy stoves were scaled-down working equivalents of the real thing. Girls could use their stoves along with a toy waffle iron or small skillet to whip up breakfast. If that wasn’t enough fun, they could heat up a miniature flatiron and iron their dolls’ clothes. Designed to help girls understand their domestic duties, these toys were the gendered equivalent of their brothers’ <a href=""https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object/nmah_847046"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">toy steam engines</a>. If you’re thinking fossil-fuel-powered “educational toys” are a recipe for disaster, you are correct. Many children suffered serious burns and sometimes death by literally playing with fire. Then again, people in the 1950s thought <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/fun-and-uranium-for-the-whole-family-in-this-1950s-science-kit"" target=""_self"">playing with uranium</a> was safe.</p><p>When electric toy stoves came on the scene in the 1910s, things didn’t get much safer, as the new entrants also lacked basic safety features. The burners on the 1930 Lionel range, for example, could only be turned off or on, but at least kids weren’t cooking over an open flame. At 86 centimeters tall, the Lionel range was also significantly larger than its more diminutive predecessors. Just the right height for young children to cook standing up.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Photo of a black and silver toy electric stove with two pots plus a book entitled Western Electric Junior Cook Book"" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""2fd9c"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-black-and-silver-toy-electric-stove-with-two-pots-plus-a-book-entitled-western-electric-junior-cook-book.jpg?id=62219520&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">Western Electric’s Junior Electric Range was demonstrated at an expo in 1915 in New York City.</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">The Strong</small></p><p>Well before the Lionel stove, the Western Electric Co. had a cohort of girls demonstrating its Junior Electric Range at the Electrical Exposition held in New York City in 1915. The Junior Electric held its own in a display of regular sewing-machine motors, vacuum cleaners, and electric washing machines.</p><p>The Junior Electric stood about 30 cm tall with six burners and an oven. The electric cord plugged into a light fixture socket. Children played with it while sitting on the floor or as it sat on a table. A visitor to the Expo declared the miniature range “the greatest electrical novelty in years.” Cooking by electricity in any form was still innovative—George A. Hughes had introduced his eponymous electric range just five years earlier. When the Junior Electric came along, <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/article/the-life-of-american-workers-in-1915.htm"" target=""_blank"">less than a third of U.S. households</a> had been wired for electric lights.</p><h2>How electricity turned cooking into a science</h2><p>One reason to give little girls working toy stoves was so they could learn how to differentiate between a hot flame and low heat and get a feel for cooking without burning the food. These are skills that come with experience. Directions like “bake until done in a moderate oven,” a common line in 19th-century recipes, require a lot more tacit knowledge than is needed to, say, throw together a modern boxed brownie mix. The latter comes with detailed instructions and assumes you can control your oven temperature to within a few degrees. That type of precision simply didn’t exist in the 19th century, in large part because it was so difficult to calibrate wood- or coal-burning appliances. Girls needed to start young to master these skills by the time they married and were expected to handle the household cooking on their own.</p><p>Electricity changed the game.</p><p>In his comparison of “fireless cookers,” an engineer named <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6590440"" target=""_blank"">Percy Wilcox Gumaer</a> exhaustively tested four different electric ovens and then presented his findings at the 32nd Annual Convention of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (a forerunner of today’s IEEE) on 2 July 1915. At the time, metered electricity was more expensive than gas or coal, so Gumaer investigated the most economical form of cooking with electricity, comparing different approaches such as longer cooking at low heat versus faster cooking in a hotter oven, the effect of heat loss when opening the oven door, and the benefits of searing meat on the stovetop versus in the oven before making a roast.</p><p>Gumaer wasn’t starting from scratch. Similar to how Yoshitada Minami needed to learn the ideal rice recipe before he could design an <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/toshiba-rice-cooker"" target=""_self"">automatic rice cooker</a>, Gumaer decided that he needed to understand the principles of roasting beef. Minami had turned to his wife, Fumiko, who spent five years researching and testing variations of rice cooking. Gumaer turned to the work of Elizabeth C. Sprague, a research assistant in nutrition investigations at the University of Illinois, and H.S. Grindley, a professor of general chemistry there.</p><p>In their 1907 publication “<a href=""https://archive.org/details/cu31924003582503"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">A Precise Method of Roasting Beef</a>,” Sprague and Grindley had defined qualitative terms like medium rare and well done by precisely measuring the internal temperature in the center of the roast. They concluded that beef could be roasted at an oven temperature between 100 and 200 °C.</p><p>Continuing that investigation, Gumaer tested 22 roasts at 100, 120, 140, 160, and 180 °C, measuring the time they took to reach rare, medium rare, and well done, and calculating the cost per kilowatt-hour. He repeated his tests for biscuits, bread, and sponge cake.</p><p>In case you’re wondering, Gumaer determined that cooking with electricity could be a few cents cheaper than other methods if you roasted the beef at 120 °C instead of 180 °C. It’s also more cost-effective to sear beef on the stovetop rather than in the oven. Biscuits tasted best when baked at 200 to 240 °C, while sponge cake was best between 170 and 200 °C. Bread was better at 180 to 240 °C, but too many other factors affected its quality. In true electrical engineering fashion, Gumaer concluded that “it is possible to reduce the art of cooking with electricity to an exact science.”</p><h2>Electric toy stoves as educational tools</h2><p>This semester, I’m teaching an introductory class on women’s and gender studies, and I told my students about the Lionel toy oven. They were horrified by the inherent danger. One incredulous student kept asking, “This is real? This is not a joke?” Instead of learning to cook with a toy that could heat to 260 °C, many of us grew up with the Easy-Bake Oven. The 1969 model could reach about 177° C with its two 100-watt incandescent light bulbs. That was still hot enough to cause burns, but somehow it seemed safer. (Since 2011, Easy-Bakes have used a heating element instead of lightbulbs.)</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Photo of a box for a purple and green toy oven."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""15cbd"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-box-for-a-purple-and-green-toy-oven.jpg?id=62219526&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">The Queasy Bake Cookerator, designed to whip up “gross-looking, great-tasting snacks,” was marketed to boys. </small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">The Strong</small></p><p>The Easy-Bake I had wasn’t particularly gendered. It was orange and brown and meant to look like a different new-fangled appliance of the day, the microwave oven. But by the time my students were playing with Easy-Bake Ovens, the models were in the girly hues of pink and purple. In 2002, Hasbro briefly tried to lure boys by releasing the <a href=""https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/oven-queasy-bake-cookerator-hasbro-inc/EAGAnW_bfiaP1A"" target=""_blank"">Queasy Bake Cookerator</a>, which the company marketed with disgusting-sounding foods like Chocolate Crud Cake and Mucky Mud. The campaign didn’t work, and the toy was soon withdrawn.</p><p>Similarly, Lionel’s electric toy range didn’t last long on the market. Launched in 1930, it had been discontinued by 1932, but that may have had more to do with timing. The toy cost US $29.50, the equivalent of a men’s suit, a new bed, or a month’s rent. In the midst of a global depression, the toy stove was an extravagance. Lionel reverted to selling electric trains to boys.</p><p>My students discussed whether cooking is still a gendered activity. Although they agreed that meal prep disproportionately falls on women even now, they acknowledged the rise of the male chef and credited televised cooking shows with closing the gender gap. As a surprise, we discovered that one of the students in the class, Haley Mattes, competed in and <a href=""https://www.ciachef.edu/blog/keeping-chopped-junior-winner-haley-mattes/"" target=""_blank"">won <em><em>Chopped Junior</em></em></a> as a 12-year-old.</p><p>Haley had a play kitchen as a kid that was entirely fake: fake food, fake pans, fake utensils. She graduated to the Easy-Bake Oven, but really got into cooking the same way girls have done for centuries, by learning beside her grandmas.</p><p><em><em>Part of a </em></em><a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/"" target=""_self""><em><em>continuing series</em></em></a><em> </em><em><em>looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></em></p><p><em><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the December 2025 print issue as “Too Hot to Handle.”</em></em></p><h3>References</h3><br /><p>I first came across a description of Western Electric’s Junior Electric Range in “The Latest in Current Consuming Devices,” in the November 1915 issue of <em>Electrical Age.</em></p><p>The <a href=""https://www.museumofplay.org/"" target=""_blank"">Strong National Museum of Play</a>, in Rochester, N.Y., has a large collection of both cast-iron and electric stoves.

<strong>The great advances in deep learning over the past decade or so have been powered by ever-bigger models crunching ever-bigger amounts of data. Some people argue that that’s an <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-learning-computational-cost"" target=""_self"">unsustainable trajectory</a>. Do you agree that it can’t go on that way?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Andrew Ng: </strong>This is a big question. We’ve seen foundation models in NLP [natural language processing]. I’m excited about NLP models getting even bigger, and also about the potential of building foundation models in computer vision. I think there’s lots of signal to still be exploited in video: We have not been able to build foundation models yet for video because of compute bandwidth and the cost of processing video, as opposed to tokenized text. So I think that this engine of scaling up deep learning algorithms, which has been running for something like 15 years now, still has steam in it. Having said that, it only applies to certain problems, and there’s a set of other problems that need small data solutions.
</p><p>
<strong>When you say you want a foundation model for computer vision, what do you mean by that?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> This is a term coined by <a href=""https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Percy Liang</a> and <a href=""https://crfm.stanford.edu/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">some of my friends at Stanford</a> to refer to very large models, trained on very large data sets, that can be tuned for specific applications. For example, <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-ais-powerful-text-generating-tool-is-ready-for-business"" target=""_self"">GPT-3</a> is an example of a foundation model [for NLP]. Foundation models offer a lot of promise as a new paradigm in developing machine learning applications, but also challenges in terms of making sure that they’re reasonably fair and free from bias, especially if many of us will be building on top of them.
</p><p>
<strong>What needs to happen for someone to build a foundation model for video?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> I think there is a scalability problem. The compute power needed to process the large volume of images for video is significant, and I think that’s why foundation models have arisen first in NLP. Many researchers are working on this, and I think we’re seeing early signs of such models being developed in computer vision. But I’m confident that if a semiconductor maker gave us 10 times more processor power, we could easily find 10 times more video to build such models for vision.
</p><p>
	Having said that, a lot of what’s happened over the past decade is that deep learning has happened in consumer-facing companies that have large user bases, sometimes billions of users, and therefore very large data sets. While that paradigm of machine learning has driven a lot of economic value in consumer software, I find that that recipe of scale doesn’t work for other industries.
</p><p>
<a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#top"">Back to top</a>
</p><p>
<strong>It’s funny to hear you say that, because your early work was at a consumer-facing company with millions of users.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Over a decade ago, when I proposed starting the <a href=""https://research.google/teams/brain/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Google Brain</a> project to use Google’s compute infrastructure to build very large neural networks, it was a controversial step. One very senior person pulled me aside and warned me that starting Google Brain would be bad for my career. I think he felt that the action couldn’t just be in scaling up, and that I should instead focus on architecture innovation.
</p><p class=""pull-quote"">
	“In many industries where giant data sets simply don’t exist, I think the focus has to shift from big data to good data. Having 50 thoughtfully engineered examples can be sufficient to explain to the neural network what you want it to learn.”<br />
	—Andrew Ng, CEO & Founder, Landing AI
</p><p>
	I remember when my students and I published the first 
	<a href=""https://nips.cc/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">NeurIPS</a> workshop paper advocating using <a href=""https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">CUDA</a>, a platform for processing on GPUs, for deep learning—a different senior person in AI sat me down and said, “CUDA is really complicated to program. As a programming paradigm, this seems like too much work.” I did manage to convince him; the other person I did not convince.
</p><p>
<strong>I expect they’re both convinced now.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> I think so, yes.
</p><p>
	Over the past year as I’ve been speaking to people about the data-centric AI movement, I’ve been getting flashbacks to when I was speaking to people about deep learning and scalability 10 or 15 years ago. In the past year, I’ve been getting the same mix of “there’s nothing new here” and “this seems like the wrong direction.”
</p><p>
<a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#top"">Back to top</a>
</p><p>
<strong>How do you define data-centric AI, and why do you consider it a movement?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> Data-centric AI is the discipline of systematically engineering the data needed to successfully build an AI system. For an AI system, you have to implement some algorithm, say a neural network, in code and then train it on your data set. The dominant paradigm over the last decade was to download the data set while you focus on improving the code. Thanks to that paradigm, over the last decade deep learning networks have improved significantly, to the point where for a lot of applications the code—the neural network architecture—is basically a solved problem. So for many practical applications, it’s now more productive to hold the neural network architecture fixed, and instead find ways to improve the data.
</p><p>
	When I started speaking about this, there were many practitioners who, completely appropriately, raised their hands and said, “Yes, we’ve been doing this for 20 years.” This is the time to take the things that some individuals have been doing intuitively and make it a systematic engineering discipline.
</p><p>
	The data-centric AI movement is much bigger than one company or group of researchers. My collaborators and I organized a 
	<a href=""https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/workshop/21860"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">data-centric AI workshop at NeurIPS</a>, and I was really delighted at the number of authors and presenters that showed up.
</p><p>
<strong>You often talk about companies or institutions that have only a small amount of data to work with. How can data-centric AI help them?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>You hear a lot about vision systems built with millions of images—I once built a face recognition system using 350 million images. Architectures built for hundreds of millions of images don’t work with only 50 images. But it turns out, if you have 50 really good examples, you can build something valuable, like a defect-inspection system. In many industries where giant data sets simply don’t exist, I think the focus has to shift from big data to good data. Having 50 thoughtfully engineered examples can be sufficient to explain to the neural network what you want it to learn.
</p><p>
<strong>When you talk about training a model with just 50 images, does that really mean you’re taking an existing model that was trained on a very large data set and fine-tuning it? Or do you mean a brand new model that’s designed to learn only from that small data set?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Let me describe what Landing AI does. When doing visual inspection for manufacturers, we often use our own flavor of <a href=""https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/how-retinanet-works/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">RetinaNet</a>. It is a pretrained model. Having said that, the pretraining is a small piece of the puzzle. What’s a bigger piece of the puzzle is providing tools that enable the manufacturer to pick the right set of images [to use for fine-tuning] and label them in a consistent way. There’s a very practical problem we’ve seen spanning vision, NLP, and speech, where even human annotators don’t agree on the appropriate label. For big data applications, the common response has been: If the data is noisy, let’s just get a lot of data and the algorithm will average over it. But if you can develop tools that flag where the data’s inconsistent and give you a very targeted way to improve the consistency of the data, that turns out to be a more efficient way to get a high-performing system.
</p><p class=""pull-quote"">
	“Collecting more data often helps, but if you try to collect more data for everything, that can be a very expensive activity.”<br />
	—Andrew Ng
</p><p>
	For example, if you have 10,000 images where 30 images are of one class, and those 30 images are labeled inconsistently, one of the things we do is build tools to draw your attention to the subset of data that’s inconsistent. So you can very quickly relabel those images to be more consistent, and this leads to improvement in performance.
</p><p>
<strong>Could this focus on high-quality data help with bias in data sets? If you’re able to curate the data more before training?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> Very much so. Many researchers have pointed out that biased data is one factor among many leading to biased systems. There have been many thoughtful efforts to engineer the data. At the NeurIPS workshop, <a href=""https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Olga Russakovsky</a> gave a really nice talk on this. At the main NeurIPS conference, I also really enjoyed <a href=""https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/invited-talk/22281"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Mary Gray’s presentation,</a> which touched on how data-centric AI is one piece of the solution, but not the entire solution. New tools like <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/datasheets-for-datasets/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Datasheets for Datasets</a> also seem like an important piece of the puzzle.
</p><p>
	One of the powerful tools that data-centric AI gives us is the ability to engineer a subset of the data. Imagine training a machine-learning system and finding that its performance is okay for most of the data set, but its performance is biased for just a subset of the data. If you try to change the whole neural network architecture to improve the performance on just that subset, it’s quite difficult. But if you can engineer a subset of the data you can address the problem in a much more targeted way.
</p><p>
<strong>When you talk about engineering the data, what do you mean exactly?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>In AI, data cleaning is important, but the way the data has been cleaned has often been in very manual ways. In computer vision, someone may visualize images through a <a href=""https://jupyter.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Jupyter notebook</a> and maybe spot the problem, and maybe fix it. But I’m excited about tools that allow you to have a very large data set, tools that draw your attention quickly and efficiently to the subset of data where, say, the labels are noisy. Or to quickly bring your attention to the one class among 100 classes where it would benefit you to collect more data. Collecting more data often helps, but if you try to collect more data for everything, that can be a very expensive activity.
</p><p>
	For example, I once figured out that a speech-recognition system was performing poorly when there was car noise in the background. Knowing that allowed me to collect more data with car noise in the background, rather than trying to collect more data for everything, which would have been expensive and slow.
</p><p>
<a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#top"">Back to top</a>
</p><p>
<strong>What about using synthetic data, is that often a good solution?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>I think synthetic data is an important tool in the tool chest of data-centric AI. At the NeurIPS workshop, <a href=""https://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Anima Anandkumar</a> gave a great talk that touched on synthetic data. I think there are important uses of synthetic data that go beyond just being a preprocessing step for increasing the data set for a learning algorithm. I’d love to see more tools to let developers use synthetic data generation as part of the closed loop of iterative machine learning development.
</p><p>
<strong>Do you mean that synthetic data would allow you to try the model on more data sets?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Not really. Here’s an example. Let’s say you’re trying to detect defects in a smartphone casing. There are many different types of defects on smartphones. It could be a scratch, a dent, pit marks, discoloration of the material, other types of blemishes. If you train the model and then find through error analysis that it’s doing well overall but it’s performing poorly on pit marks, then synthetic data generation allows you to address the problem in a more targeted way. You could generate more data just for the pit-mark category.
</p><p class=""pull-quote"">
	“In the consumer software Internet, we could train a handful of machine-learning models to serve a billion users. In manufacturing, you might have 10,000 manufacturers building 10,000 custom AI models.”<br />
	—Andrew Ng
</p><p>
	Synthetic data generation is a very powerful tool, but there are many simpler tools that I will often try first. Such as data augmentation, improving labeling consistency, or just asking a factory to collect more data.

<strong>To make these issues more concrete, can you walk me through an example? When a company approaches <a href=""https://landing.ai/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Landing AI</a> and says it has a problem with visual inspection, how do you onboard them and work toward deployment?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>When a customer approaches us we usually have a conversation about their inspection problem and look at a few images to verify that the problem is feasible with computer vision. Assuming it is, we ask them to upload the data to the <a href=""https://landing.ai/platform/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">LandingLens</a> platform. We often advise them on the methodology of data-centric AI and help them label the data.

	One of the foci of Landing AI is to empower manufacturing companies to do the machine learning work themselves. A lot of our work is making sure the software is fast and easy to use. Through the iterative process of machine learning development, we advise customers on things like how to train models on the platform, when and how to improve the labeling of data so the performance of the model improves. Our training and software supports them all the way through deploying the trained model to an edge device in the factory.
</p><p>
<strong>How do you deal with changing needs? If products change or lighting conditions change in the factory, can the model keep up?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> It varies by manufacturer. There is data drift in many contexts. But there are some manufacturers that have been running the same manufacturing line for 20 years now with few changes, so they don’t expect changes in the next five years. Those stable environments make things easier. For other manufacturers, we provide tools to flag when there’s a significant data-drift issue. I find it really important to empower manufacturing customers to correct data, retrain, and update the model. Because if something changes and it’s 3 a.m. in the United States, I want them to be able to adapt their learning algorithm right away to maintain operations.
</p><p>
	In the consumer software Internet, we could train a handful of machine-learning models to serve a billion users. In manufacturing, you might have 10,000 manufacturers building 10,000 custom AI models. The challenge is, how do you do that without Landing AI having to hire 10,000 machine learning specialists?
</p><p>
<strong>So you’re saying that to make it scale, you have to empower customers to do a lot of the training and other work.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Yes, exactly! This is an industry-wide problem in AI, not just in manufacturing. Look at health care. Every hospital has its own slightly different format for electronic health records. How can every hospital train its own custom AI model? Expecting every hospital’s IT personnel to invent new neural-network architectures is unrealistic. The only way out of this dilemma is to build tools that empower the customers to build their own models by giving them tools to engineer the data and express their domain knowledge. That’s what Landing AI is executing in computer vision, and the field of AI needs other teams to execute this in other domains.
</p><p>
<strong>Is there anything else you think it’s important for people to understand about the work you’re doing or the data-centric AI movement?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>In the last decade, the biggest shift in AI was a shift to deep learning. I think it’s quite possible that in this decade the biggest shift will be to data-centric AI. With the maturity of today’s neural network architectures, I think for a lot of the practical applications the bottleneck will be whether we can efficiently get the data we need to develop systems that work well. The data-centric AI movement has tremendous energy and momentum across the whole community. I hope more researchers and developers will jump in and work on it.

Engineers and designers can do only so much to <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/ibm-introduces-the-worlds-first-2nm-node-chip"" target=""_self"">miniaturize transistors</a> and <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/cerebras-giant-ai-chip-now-has-a-trillions-more-transistors"" target=""_self"">pack as many of them as possible into chips</a>. So they’re turning to other approaches to chip design, incorporating technologies like AI into the process.</p><p>Samsung, for instance, is <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/processing-in-dram-accelerates-ai"" target=""_self"">adding AI to its memory chips</a> to enable processing in memory, thereby saving energy and speeding up machine learning. Speaking of speed, Google’s TPU V4 AI chip has <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/heres-how-googles-tpu-v4-ai-chip-stacked-up-in-training-tests"" target=""_self"">doubled its processing power</a> compared with that of  its previous version.</p><p>But AI holds still more promise and potential for the semiconductor industry. To better understand how AI is set to revolutionize chip design, we spoke with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-gorr-phd"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Heather Gorr</a>, senior product manager for <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">MathWorks</a>’ MATLAB platform.</p><p><strong>How is AI currently being used to design the next generation of chips?</strong></p><p><strong>Heather Gorr:</strong> AI is such an important technology because it’s involved in most parts of the cycle, including the design and manufacturing process. There’s a lot of important applications here, even in the general process engineering where we want to optimize things. I think defect detection is a big one at all phases of the process, especially in manufacturing. But even thinking ahead in the design process, [AI now plays a significant role] when you’re designing the light and the sensors and all the different components. There’s a lot of anomaly detection and fault mitigation that you really want to consider.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25 rm-float-left"" style=""float: left;"">

<small class=""image-media media-caption"">Heather Gorr</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">MathWorks</small></p><p>Then, thinking about the logistical modeling that you see in any industry, there is always planned downtime that you want to mitigate; but you also end up having unplanned downtime. So, looking back at that historical data of when you’ve had those moments where maybe it took a bit longer than expected to manufacture something, you can take a look at all of that data and use AI to try to identify the proximate cause or to see  something that might jump out even in the processing and design phases. We think of AI oftentimes as a predictive tool, or as a robot doing something, but a lot of times you get a lot of insight from the data through AI.</p><p><strong>What are the benefits of using AI for chip design?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> Historically, we’ve seen a lot of physics-based modeling, which is a very intensive process. We want to do a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_order_reduction"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">reduced order model</a>, where instead of solving such a computationally expensive and extensive model, we can do something a little cheaper. You could create a surrogate model, so to speak, of that physics-based model, use the data, and then do your <a href=""https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/idmtools/parameter-sweeps.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">parameter sweeps</a>, your optimizations, your <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/monte-carlo-simulation"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Monte Carlo simulations</a> using the surrogate model. That takes a lot less time computationally than solving the physics-based equations directly. So, we’re seeing that benefit in many ways, including the efficiency and economy that are the results of iterating quickly on the experiments and the simulations that will really help in the design.</p><p><strong>So it’s like having a digital twin in a sense?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> Exactly. That’s pretty much what people are doing, where you have the physical system model and the experimental data. Then, in conjunction, you have this other model that you could tweak and tune and try different parameters and experiments that let sweep through all of those different situations and come up with a better design in the end.</p><p><strong>So, it’s going to be more efficient and, as you said, cheaper?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> Yeah, definitely. Especially in the experimentation and design phases, where you’re trying different things. That’s obviously going to yield dramatic cost savings if you’re actually manufacturing and producing [the chips]. You want to simulate, test, experiment as much as possible without making something using the actual process engineering.</p><p><strong>We’ve talked about the benefits. How about the drawbacks?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr: </strong>The [AI-based experimental models] tend to not be as accurate as physics-based models. Of course, that’s why you do many simulations and parameter sweeps. But that’s also the benefit of having that digital twin, where you can keep that in mind—it’s not going to be as accurate as that precise model that we’ve developed over the years.</p><p>Both chip design and manufacturing are system intensive; you have to consider every little part. And that can be really challenging. It’s a case where you might have models to predict something and different parts of it, but you still need to bring it all together.</p><p>One of the other things to think about too is that you need the data to build the models. You have to incorporate data from all sorts of different sensors and different sorts of teams, and so that heightens the challenge.</p><p><strong>How can engineers use AI to better prepare and extract insights from hardware or sensor data?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr: </strong>We always think about using AI to predict something or do some robot task, but you can use AI to come up with patterns and pick out things you might not have noticed before on your own. People will use AI when they have high-frequency data coming from many different sensors, and a lot of times it’s useful to explore the frequency domain and things like data synchronization or resampling. Those can be really challenging if you’re not sure where to start.</p><p>One of the things I would say is, use the tools that are available. There’s a vast community of people working on these things, and you can find lots of examples [of applications and techniques] on <a href=""https://github.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">GitHub</a> or <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">MATLAB Central</a>, where people have shared nice examples, even little apps they’ve created. I think many of us are buried in data and just not sure what to do with it, so definitely take advantage of what’s already out there in the community. You can explore and see what makes sense to you, and bring in that balance of domain knowledge and the insight you get from the tools and AI.</p><p><strong>What should engineers and designers consider wh</strong><strong>en using AI for chip design?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> Think through what problems you’re trying to solve or what insights you might hope to find, and try to be clear about that. Consider all of the different components, and document and test each of those different parts. Consider all of the people involved, and explain and hand off in a way that is sensible for the whole team.</p><p><strong>How do you think AI will affect chip designers’ jobs?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> It’s going to free up a lot of human capital for more advanced tasks. We can use AI to reduce waste, to optimize the materials, to optimize the design, but then you still have that human involved whenever it comes to decision-making. I think it’s a great example of people and technology working hand in hand. It’s also an industry where all people involved—even on the manufacturing floor—need to have some level of understanding of what’s happening, so this is a great industry for advancing AI because of how we test things and how we think about them before we put them on the chip.</p><p><strong>How do you envision the future of AI and chip design?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr</strong><strong>:</strong> It’s very much dependent on that human element—involving people in the process and having that interpretable model. We can do many things with the mathematical minutiae of modeling, but it comes down to how people are using it, how everybody in the process is understanding and applying it. Communication and involvement of people of all skill levels in the process are going to be really important. We’re going to see less of those superprecise predictions and more transparency of information, sharing, and that digital twin—not only using AI but also using our human knowledge and all of the work that many people have done over the years.</p>",https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-chip-design-matlab,Rina Diane Caballar,"Chip fabrication,Matlab,Moore’s law,Chip design,Ai,Digital twins",spectrum.ieee.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""IEEE Spectrum"",""url"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/rss/fulltext"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""media""},""raw"":{""id"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-chip-design-matlab""}}"

Of these challenges two critical issues stand out: miniaturization and qubit quality.</p><p>IBM has adopted the superconducting qubit road map of <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/ibms-envisons-the-road-to-quantum-computing-like-an-apollo-mission"" target=""_self"">reaching a 1,121-qubit processor by 2023</a>, leading to the expectation that 1,000 qubits with today’s qubit form factor is feasible. However, current approaches will require very large chips (50 millimeters on a side, or larger) at the scale of small wafers, or the use of chiplets on multichip modules. While this approach will work, the aim is to attain a better path toward scalability.</p><p>Now researchers at <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-021-01187-w"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">MIT have been able to both reduce the size of the qubits</a> and done so in a way that reduces the interference that occurs between neighboring qubits. The MIT researchers have increased the number of superconducting qubits that can be added onto a device by a factor of 100.</p><p>“We are addressing both qubit miniaturization and quality,” said <a href=""https://equs.mit.edu/william-d-oliver/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">William Oliver</a>, the director for the <a href=""https://cqe.mit.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Center for Quantum Engineering</a> at MIT. “Unlike conventional transistor scaling, where only the number really matters, for qubits, large numbers are not sufficient, they must also be high-performance. Sacrificing performance for qubit number is not a useful trade in quantum computing. They must go hand in hand.”</p><p>The key to this big increase in qubit density and reduction of interference comes down to the use of two-dimensional materials, in particular the 2D insulator hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The MIT researchers demonstrated that a few atomic monolayers of hBN can be stacked to form the insulator in the capacitors of a superconducting qubit.</p><p>Just like other capacitors, the capacitors in these superconducting circuits take the form of a sandwich in which an insulator material is sandwiched between two metal plates. The big difference for these capacitors is that the superconducting circuits can operate only at extremely low temperatures—less than 0.02 degrees above absolute zero (-273.15 °C).</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25 rm-float-left"" style=""float: left;"">

<small class=""image-media media-caption"">Superconducting qubits are measured at temperatures as low as 20 millikelvin in a dilution refrigerator.</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">Nathan Fiske/MIT</small></p><p>In that environment, insulating materials that are available for the job, such as PE-CVD silicon oxide or silicon nitride, have quite a few defects that are too lossy for quantum computing applications. To get around these material shortcomings, most superconducting circuits use what are called coplanar capacitors. In these capacitors, the plates are positioned laterally to one another, rather than on top of one another.</p><p>As a result, the intrinsic silicon substrate below the plates and to a smaller degree the vacuum above the plates serve as the capacitor dielectric. Intrinsic silicon is chemically pure and therefore has few defects, and the large size dilutes the electric field at the plate interfaces, all of which leads to a low-loss capacitor. The lateral size of each plate in this open-face design ends up being quite large (typically 100 by 100 micrometers) in order to achieve the required capacitance.</p><p>In an effort to move away from the large lateral configuration, the MIT researchers embarked on a search for an insulator that has very few defects and is compatible with superconducting capacitor plates.</p><p>“We chose to study hBN because it is the most widely used insulator in 2D material research due to its cleanliness and chemical inertness,” said colead author <a href=""https://equs.mit.edu/joel-wang/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Joel Wang</a>, a research scientist in the Engineering Quantum Systems group of the MIT Research Laboratory for Electronics. </p><p>On either side of the hBN, the MIT researchers used the 2D superconducting material, niobium diselenide. One of the trickiest aspects of fabricating the capacitors was working with the niobium diselenide, which oxidizes in seconds when exposed to air, according to Wang. This necessitates that the assembly of the capacitor occur in a glove box filled with argon gas.</p><p>While this would seemingly complicate the scaling up of the production of these capacitors, Wang doesn’t regard this as a limiting factor.</p><p>“What determines the quality factor of the capacitor are the two interfaces between the two materials,” said Wang. “Once the sandwich is made, the two interfaces are “sealed” and we don’t see any noticeable degradation over time when exposed to the atmosphere.”</p><p>This lack of degradation is because around 90 percent of the electric field is contained within the sandwich structure, so the oxidation of the outer surface of the niobium diselenide does not play a significant role anymore. This ultimately makes the capacitor footprint much smaller, and it accounts for the reduction in cross talk between the neighboring qubits.</p><p>“The main challenge for scaling up the fabrication will be the wafer-scale growth of hBN and 2D superconductors like [niobium diselenide], and how one can do wafer-scale stacking of these films,” added Wang.</p><p>Wang believes that this research has shown 2D hBN to be a good insulator candidate for superconducting qubits. He says that the groundwork the MIT team has done will serve as a road map for using other hybrid 2D materials to build superconducting circuits.</p>",https://spectrum.ieee.org/2d-hbn-qubit,Dexter Johnson,"Quantum computing,2d materials,Ibm,Qubits,Hexagonal boron nitride,Superconducting qubits,Mit",spectrum.ieee.org,,,,,,,2025-12-12,"{""rss"":{""name"":""IEEE Spectrum"",""url"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/rss/fulltext"",""country"":""US"",""lang"":""en"",""type"":""media""},""raw"":{""id"":""https://spectrum.ieee.org/2d-hbn-qubit""}}"
